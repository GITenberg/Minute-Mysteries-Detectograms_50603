<h2 id="c1"><br />FOREWORD</h2>
<p>The solution of criminal mysteries constitutes
one of the most absorbing, possibly the most
intriguing forms of mental activity existent.
It calls for something more than mere cold intelligence
and reasoning ability, requiring in
addition native perception, intuition, and a
natural understanding of human behavior
under stress of emotion and passion. Furthermore,
some knowledge of pathological or abnormal
behaviorism is a requisite.</p>
<p>Mr. Ripley&rsquo;s excellently thought-out series
of mysteries might be said to represent a very
adequate cross-section of the problems perennially
confronting the law-enforcers and official
crime-solvers of the nation. The points of
evidence are cleverly assembled and the
<i>nuances</i> of incrimination are very subtly
shaded.</p>
<p>It would be well for the reader interested in
successfully solving these problems to endeavor
to think, not as a detective, but as the
criminal in the case would think, in order to
arrive at a correct solution. I have found that
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
to deal adequately with the criminal after
conviction, and while in confinement, it is
necessary to understand his personal problems.
To accomplish this, one must first think as does
the criminal, discover the sequent conclusions
upon which he based his anti-social activities,
and thereupon make use of these findings to
assist him toward rehabilitation.</p>
<p>In this novel challenge to amateur criminologists,
who suffer from a dearth of laboratory
specimens upon which to experiment, Mr.
Ripley offers an excellent opportunity&mdash;that
of examining and forming conclusions upon the
more elemental, vital, and dramatic aspects of
various typical criminal situations, without
the drawback of fantasy and concocted sordidness,
which, for the practical criminologist,
takes the glamour and color out of this thing
called&mdash;<span class="sc">Crime</span>.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</h2>
<p>Chief Inspector Kelley, that grizzled veteran
of the Detective Bureau, was talking to
his nephew, Jim Barry, who had indicated a
desire to enter the uncrowded field of criminology.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The average policeman,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;looks
upon the lay criminologist in much the same
manner as the professional in any field regards
the amateur. Generally speaking, that attitude
is justified.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In thirty years of police work, however, I
have met no one in detective circles, in or out
of the force, who so effectively combines theoretical
knowledge with practical application
as Professor Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man of definite scientific attainments and
recognition, he yet appreciates that the simple
fundamentals of crime detection are effective
in ninety per cent of all criminal cases. While
he has unraveled by scientific means some
amazing and extremely baffling crimes that
otherwise would have gone unsolved, he puts
his greatest reliance on those basic principles
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
upon which rests the whole structure of crime
detection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His major theory is that most crimes are
simple; that their solution calls only for the
exercise of ordinary talents developed to an
extraordinary degree; that the stupidity of the
average criminal himself, and not the brilliance
of the detective, is responsible for his
detection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that, I might tell you, he finds complete
corroboration in the experience of such an outstanding
detective of world-wide reputation
as Sir Melville L. Macnaghten, C.B., late
Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department
of Scotland Yard. Commenting on the
capture of a particularly vicious murderer, he
remarked, &ldquo;But for the fact that the student
of criminal history is constantly faced with
the stupidity of the criminal, there would be
nothing more remarkable in this case than the
fatuity of the man who, having murdered
solely for personal gratifications, and taken
every precaution, as he thought, to avoid discovery,
immediately wrote blackmailing letters
in which he showed guilty knowledge of a
secret murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fordney could undoubtedly explain such
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
an inconsistency as this by his uncanny knowledge
of criminal psychology,&rsquo; continued Kelley.
&lsquo;Among psychologists his insight into
the criminal mind and its reactions is appreciated
as being authoritative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His greatest interest is his class in criminology
at the University. He still finds time,
however, to assist actively the police of many
cities who frequently consult him on cases
they find unusually puzzling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are instances also in which his part
has been that of a bystander, where a word of
suggestion, modestly given, has frequently
disposed of cases before they were brought to
the attention of the police.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the Professor is convinced you have the
natural qualifications, Jim, and a real inclination
for work, I can get you into his class. He
will take not only a personal, but a fatherly,
interest in you, as in the rest of his students.
You will receive the finest possible training
given by a man of broad understanding and
great human sympathies. Out of his vast experience
and knowledge, gained in studying
crime in all parts of the world, he will develop
in you those qualities essential to success in
this field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</div>
<p>&lsquo;You will find him a genial, ruddy, kindly
man of fifty, with a waistline of forty. There
is nothing subtle in his face or manner. A
characterful nose rises above a strong and determined
mouth, adorned by a blond mustache.
A pair of keen but smiling blue eyes
completes a commonplace face. Although he
refuses to admit it, his rapidly thinning hair
causes him great concern. A bit vain, the old
codger, but don&rsquo;t tell him I told you so,&rsquo;
laughed the Inspector.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scrupulously dressed, he looks like an
amiable and highly successful business executive.
He&rsquo;s a mixer and thoroughly enjoys the
good things of life. He views the passing
parade with a keen sense of humor, few illusions,
and a genuine interest in his fellow man.
Detests hypocrisy; would rather see ten guilty
men acquitted than one innocent man condemned.
Recognizes his own fallibility, but
knows his own worth and does not suffer from
that abominable social vice, false modesty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might be interested in knowing his
only hobby is that of designing, making, and
repairing toys for children. He&rsquo;s known to
hundreds of them as the Toy Man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Though a bachelor, he looks with favor on
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
the ladies, enjoys their company and is thoroughly
sociable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure and an education to know
him. More than once he&rsquo;s helped your old
uncle and absolutely refused the credit that
was his,&rsquo; concluded Inspector Kelley.</p>
<p class="tb">In the following pages you will find some
interesting experiences taken from the Professor&rsquo;s
case book. They illustrate forcibly his
contention that crime is simple and that most
criminals are caught, not by any superhuman
qualities of the detective, but by their own
ignorance, stupidity, or carelessness.</p>
<p>In these accounts every fact, every clue
necessary to the solution is given. The answer
is in the story itself. You need look nowhere
else but there. Each problem has only one
possible solution.</p>
<p>Written in less than two hundred and sixty
words, these little stories can be read in a
minute.</p>
<p>Here is your chance to work on an absolute
equality with the Professor; to match your
wits with his and the criminal&rsquo;s. You know as
much as the Professor does. Now you have an
opportunity of proving just how good a detective
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
you are and what poor detectives your
friends are.</p>
<p>The author hopes you will find them as fascinating
reading as they were in the telling by
the Professor.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><br />IT STANDS TO REASON!
<br /><span class="small">A NEW NATIONAL GAME</span></h2>
<p>Here is a fascinating game of wits for a party
of any size. It can be played in either of
two ways.</p>
<p>1. Select one or more stories from the
<i>Minute Mysteries</i> that particularly appeal
to you. Make as many copies of each as
there are guests at the party. Then pass the
copies around and allow three minutes, say,
for your guests to study them. At the end
of this time each must hand you a written
solution, giving the line of reasoning which
was used. You compare these with the solutions
at the back of the book; the one who
is most often correct is the winner.</p>
<p>2. Instead of making copies of each story,
you may read it aloud, slowly and carefully.
If any of the listeners so desire, it may be
read a second time. But after this no questions
may be asked.</p>
<p>After the period agreed upon has elapsed,
each guest writes out his solution as in (1),
<span class="pb" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
and hands it to you for comparison with the
book.</p>
<p class="tb">Method number 1 puts the emphasis on
one&rsquo;s powers of reasoning and analysis; method
number 2 adds to these a premium on an
accurate memory.</p>

<br /><i>A Crack Shot</i></h3>
<p>Professor Fordney was hunting in the
Rockies when informed of a tragedy at one
of the camps. Thinking he might be of some
help, he went over, and, after introducing himself,
Butler, the victim&rsquo;s companion, told him
of the accident.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Marshall hadn&rsquo;t returned to camp at
nine o&rsquo;clock last night, I was a bit worried because
he didn&rsquo;t know these mountains. There
wasn&rsquo;t a star out and it was dark and moonless,
so I decided to look around for him.
We&rsquo;re five miles from anyone, you know.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Putting more wood on the fire, I set out.
After searching for an hour, I was coming up
the slope of a ravine when I saw a pair of
eyes shining out at me in the dark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Calling twice, and getting no answer, I
fired, thinking it was a mountain lion. Imagine
my horror when I reached the spot, struck
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
a match, and saw I had nearly blown the head
off Marshall. A terrible experience!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I carried his body back to camp and then
walked to the nearest house to report the
accident.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How far from camp did you find Marshall?&rsquo;
asked Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About a quarter of a mile.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see your right hand is bandaged. How do
you manage to shoot with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I use either hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind if I look at the gun?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said Butler, handing it over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m, European make, I see. Had it long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s rather new.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you deliberately murder Marshall?&rsquo;
demanded Fordney abruptly ... &lsquo;for
that&rsquo;s what you did.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_1">How did the Professor know Butler had murdered his companion?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_2">2
<br /><i>On the Scent</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t wait to be announced,&rsquo; said George
Collins, Florida&rsquo;s foremost prohibition agent,
and a great wit, as he stepped into the Professor&rsquo;s
office.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long are you going to be in New York?&rsquo;
asked Fordney, as the two friends shook
hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m due back in Miami now,&rsquo; replied Collins,
&lsquo;but I wanted to congratulate you on your
success in the Hicks murder case. I wish interesting
things like that would happen in
my game. However, I did have an amusing experience
last December.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sneaky Joe, a stool-pigeon, tipped me off
to a huge still he said was working about forty
miles from headquarters. A narrow road
through dense woods led to the spot. Arriving
there, I found an old dilapidated shanty
screened by trees. As I entered the woods, I
smelled alcohol. Sneaky Joe was right, after
all, I thought, as I drove up to the shanty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I got out and peered cautiously around, but
the place seemed deserted. After opening the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
door and entering the house, however, I knew
liquor was not being made there. I searched
the woods, but found nothing. As I was driving
back along the road at a good rate, I discovered
the alcohol I smelled was coming from
my own radiator! Imagine my chagrin!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Professor laughed heartily and said to
his friend, &lsquo;Stay over for my birthday party
tonight, the ladies would love to hear that
yarn of yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_2">What did the Professor find preposterous in Collins&rsquo;s story?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_3">3
<br /><i>Fatal Error</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Crowley was an eccentric and taciturn old
fellow, but I liked him,&rsquo; remarked Fordney.
&lsquo;When he was found dead last December, I
took a personal interest in the case. Harold
Bronson, his last known caller, had this to say
of his visit:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;After leaving word at my hotel where I
might be reached if wanted, I arrived at
Crowley&rsquo;s suburban estate shortly after five
o&rsquo;clock. I found him seated in the dusk at the
end of his library table. Courteously enough
for him, he waved me into a chair at the other
end and invited me to dine with him at eight
o&rsquo;clock. Reaching for my cigarettes, I remembered
that Crowley did not permit
smoking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;His principal contributions to our discussion
were his usual nods of approval, grunts,
and monosyllables. Very sparing of words,
was Mr. Crowley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;About seven o&rsquo;clock the telephone rang
and he asked me to answer it. It was my wife
asking me to return at once to see an unexpected
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
visitor. Finishing the conversation, I
returned to my chair and, after I explained the
call, Crowley nodded assent to my request to
leave immediately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;On the way out, as the lights had not been
turned on, I bumped my head, which explains
this bruise. Just as I reached the door, he
called after me&mdash;&lsquo;See you tomorrow at ten.&rsquo;
He was certainly all right when I left him
shortly after seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Although Bronson&rsquo;s telephone alibi was
later proved sound, he had hardly finished his
story before I was convinced he was implicated,&rsquo;
concluded Fordney.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_3">What directed suspicion to Bronson?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_4">4
<br /><i>The Poison Murder Case</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to the theater now,&rsquo; Bob Kewley
told Professor Fordney at their club. &lsquo;I wish
you&rsquo;d spend the evening with Uncle John.
He&rsquo;s been worried lately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Upon reaching the Kewley home an hour
later, Fordney found the butler in an agitated
state.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After ordering coffee, Mr. Kewley locked
himself in his library an hour ago, sir. When I
rapped on the door just now, he didn&rsquo;t answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two men forced the lock and found John
Kewley on the floor, an empty strychnine
bottle at his side. The terrace door was
open. After a careful examination, Fordney
returned home. A few hours later, Bob Kewley
entered his living-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thought I&rsquo;d stop in on my way home.
Don&rsquo;t you think Uncle John looks worried?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your uncle, Bob, is dead. Strychnine.
Your butler and I found him lying on the
floor, but were too late to save him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How horrible, Fordney! Why was the
library door locked, do you suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&lsquo;That puzzles me. Has your butler been
with you long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For years,&rsquo; replied Bob, his head buried in
his hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a wealthy man now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What of it? Uncle John meant more to me
than all the money in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could believe that,&rsquo; replied Fordney.
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll need a better alibi than those,&rsquo;
pointing to the ticket stubs Bob was nervously
fingering.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_4">How had Kewley aroused the Professor&rsquo;s suspicions?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_5">5
<br /><i>A Strange &lsquo;Kidnaping&rsquo;</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea why I was kidnaped,&rsquo;
said Johnson to Professor Fordney, an
hour after he returned home. &lsquo;I never miss
Sunday evening services, you know, so I&rsquo;m
afraid I haven&rsquo;t much time to discuss it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, just a brief account of your experience
is all that is necessary,&rsquo; remarked the Professor.</p>
<p>So Johnson proceeded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was walking along Burnham Street about
2 <span class="small">A.M.</span> Friday when two masked men, with
drawn guns, ordered me into a blue sedan. I
was blindfolded and gagged. After driving for
about an hour, I was led into a house and down
some stairs to a small room, where they removed
my blindfold and gag. They took off
my outer clothing and hung it on a chair.
Then they questioned me at length about the
Shirley case and refused to believe I knew
nothing of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exasperated, they threatened to kill me,
and when I remonstrated, one of them hit me
on the head with a black-jack and I went down
unconscious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&lsquo;The next thing I knew was when I came to
with a terrific headache. I lay still for a few
minutes and, hearing nothing but the ticking
of my watch, I cautiously got to my feet and
groped for the door, as the room was in darkness.
Before I could locate it, two men, still
masked, entered, turned on the light, apologized
profusely for the treatment I had received,
and said they had mistaken me for
someone else. Then they gave me something to
eat, blindfolded me again, and drove me to
within a block of my home, still apologizing for
the mistake. Before I could remove my blindfold
after getting out of the car, it had sped
away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all very mysterious to me. I can&rsquo;t make
anything of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t give you away, Johnson,&rsquo; smiled the
Professor. &lsquo;Your wife undoubtedly believes
your yarn, but you&rsquo;d better think up a better
one the next time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_5">What flaw did the Professor find in Johnson&rsquo;s story which proved the &lsquo;kidnaping&rsquo; was a fake?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_6">6
<br /><i>A Valuable Formula</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;I had just stepped behind that screen near the
door to wash my hands when a man, gun in
hand, entered the room and stood motionless
for a few seconds,&rsquo; said Hyde. &lsquo;Apparently satisfied
no one was here, he walked to the desk
over there by the window. As he rummaged
through the papers in the drawer, I hastily
dialed headquarters, leaving the receiver off
the hook, trusting you would trace the call. I
was afraid to talk because I was unarmed and
he looked like a desperate fellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say he took nothing but a valuable
formula from your desk?&rsquo; inquired the Professor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all; he touched nothing else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather careless to leave such an important
paper lying about like that, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I suppose so, though it was only a
copy. I sold the original to Schmitz yesterday
for twenty thousand dollars and I intended to
destroy the duplicate tonight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would that formula be valuable to anyone
else?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it would be worth twice as much to
Schmitz&rsquo;s competitors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you sell it to them in the first
place, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Schmitz financed me while I was perfecting
the formula, so I thought it only right to sell
it to him, even though I could have got more
for it from the other firm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As this is such a small, bright room and you
observed so much through that crack in the
screen,&rsquo; said Fordney sarcastically, &lsquo;you should
be able to give us a <i>very</i> good description of the
intruder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I can do that,&rsquo; Hyde replied, with assurance.
&lsquo;He was a big fellow about six feet
tall and weighed around two hundred pounds.
He had jet-black hair, swarthy complexion, an
unusually large nose, and a vicious-looking
mouth. As he left obviously unaware of my
presence, I noticed he had a big rip in the
back of his blue coat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Hyde, as part of your story is incredible,
you can&rsquo;t expect me to believe any
of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_6">Why did the Professor say this?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_7">7
<br /><i>Strangled</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Twenty-two days of this hot, dry spell,&rsquo;
groaned Professor Fordney. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t remember
a stretch like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell us about the Greer case, Professor,&rsquo;
urged the rocking-chair brigade. &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll take
your mind off the heat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you know the salient facts. The body
of Irene Greer, lying on the railroad right-of-way,
was found half a mile from here by a
fishing party at 6 <span class="small">A.M.</span> day before yesterday.
It could be seen that she was a beautiful girl
despite the tousled hair matted with mud and
a nasty bruise on her cheek. Her flaming red
dress was torn and dirty. She had on shoes,
but no stockings. Incidentally, her clothes
were of the finest quality. Her body indicated
that she had received a terrific beating, poor
girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From appearances she had been placed on
the track with the expectation that she would
be struck by a train and identification made
impossible. No doubt she was unconscious
when this was done, but she must have revived
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
temporarily and crawled to the gravel
right-of-way before a train came along. There
she died.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A peculiar circumstance is that, while her
body was bruised and twisted, there were no
marks on her throat to indicate strangulation,
yet Dr. Bridewell says that was the cause of
death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was found in a desolate spot. Oh, yes,
she was probably strangled with a scarf which,
employed in a certain manner, would leave no
outward trace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you folks should know how I learned
Irene Greer was attacked elsewhere and then
brought to the vicinity where she was found,&rsquo;
smiled the Professor.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_7">Do you?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_8">8
<br /><i>Death in the Office</i></h3>
<p>When Professor Fordney reached Gifford&rsquo;s
office, he found a policeman already there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gifford&rsquo;s dead,&rsquo; he was told. &lsquo;What brings
you here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He telephoned me a few minutes ago;
said he had been shot; then I had a hard time
understanding him. This street is on your
beat, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. I heard the shot when I was in Smith&rsquo;s
cigar store. It took me a while to locate it.
The door was locked and I had to break in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As they walked into an inner office, they
saw Gifford&rsquo;s body, a bullet through the heart,
lying in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>Fordney stooped to pick up a revolver.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s an easy jump to the ground,&rsquo; observed
the policeman, who was standing by an open
window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you know, sir,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;that Gifford
has been troubled lately by blackmailers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. The last time I saw him, he told me
he had been shot at a couple of weeks ago.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Fordney walked over to the door and found
the lock was sprung, but the key still in it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; ventured the policeman, &lsquo;that
the blackmailers got him. They must have
locked the door from the inside when they
entered, shot him, and then jumped out the
window.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Fordney, who was examining the
key he had removed from the lock. &lsquo;There
weren&rsquo;t any murderers in here. Gifford committed
suicide.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_8">Why was the Professor sure that it was suicide?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_9">9
<br /><i>They Usually Forget Something</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Here is a good illustration of the old bromide
that the smartest criminal leaves some clue in
even the most carefully planned crime,&rsquo; mused
Professor Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While in Colshire, a beautiful little English
village, I was asked by the local police to assist
them in a rather puzzling affair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suspicion of a particularly brutal murder
had been directed toward an illiterate underworld
character. He was accused of sending
the following note found in the murdered man&rsquo;s
pocket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>sir john when i last seen you
i sed i will kill you if the muney
ain&rsquo;t here by mundy; all of it</i></p>
<p><span class="center"><i>yurs truly,</i></span>
<span class="jr"><i>XX</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;When Wellington, the Chief Constable,
asked my opinion, I told him the writer of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
note, and therefore probably the murderer,
was obviously an educated man. After explaining
why I was sure of that, he agreed
with me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An odd sort of case. The murderer was
found to be an extremely wealthy American
whose sister had married the murdered man&rsquo;s
brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; laughed Bill Cargo to whom Fordney
had been speaking. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s getting too involved
for me. I can&rsquo;t figure it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_9">How had Fordney determined the American was an educated man?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_10">10
<br /><i>The Professor Gives a Lesson</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Cardoni came into Inspector Kelley&rsquo;s office
yesterday,&rsquo; said Fordney to his Criminology
Class.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I want to speak to you alone, Chief,&rdquo; he
said, eyeing me with frank suspicion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Go ahead,&rdquo; said Kelley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some information on the Curtis
kidnapers. How much is it worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That all depends. Let&rsquo;s hear the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in one of my old buildings, down
on the East Side. Three men and a woman.
All you&rsquo;ve got to do, Chief, is to take this,
walk in an&rsquo; surprise &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said our informer,
tossing a Yale key on Kelley&rsquo;s desk. &ldquo;They
rented a room from me about a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sounds much too easy, Cardoni. I want
something more definite than that. What
makes you think they&rsquo;re the kidnapers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I heard them having an argument as I
was doing some repair work in the hall. One
of the guys threatened to squeal if he didn&rsquo;t
get a bigger cut. It sounded interestin&rsquo;, so I
peeked through the keyhole. They were sittin&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
at a table in the middle of the room on which
there was a stack of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Your story doesn&rsquo;t yet show they had any
connection with the Curtis kidnaping,&rdquo; Kelley
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NO? Well, last night I heard them mention
&lsquo;Curtis&rsquo; several times. And that ain&rsquo;t all,&rdquo;
continued Cardoni, with a triumphant air.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a code message one of them must have
dropped. Well, Chief, how much do I get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; hollered Kelley as he made a
pass at Cardoni.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_10">Why was the informer treated so rudely?</a></p>

<br /><i>Upstairs and Down</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s hear your story,&rsquo; said Inspector Kelley
to Policeman Kirk, as Fordney dropped into a
comfortable chair at Headquarters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The neighbors were worried because they
hadn&rsquo;t seen old lady Brill about for a couple of
days and asked me to investigate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Getting no answer to my ring, I broke open
the front door, ran upstairs, and, not seeing
her, ran down and through the hall, unlocked
the kitchen door, and found her on the floor,
a bullet through her heart and a gun beside her.
The windows and the doors to the porch and
cellar were locked on the inside and nothing
seemed to be disturbed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Looked like suicide to me. However, I
learned her nephew was at the house yesterday
about the time the doctor said she died, so I
brought him in,&rsquo; concluded Kirk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you run upstairs before examining
the lower floor?&rsquo; asked Kelley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thought I heard a noise up there, sir,&rsquo;
replied the policeman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&lsquo;Any finger-prints on the gun?&rsquo; inquired
Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just those of the old lady,&rsquo; answered Kelley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a key to the house,&rsquo; interrupted the
nephew. &lsquo;I went in yesterday, called to her,
but she didn&rsquo;t answer, so I thought she&rsquo;d gone
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you go upstairs?&rsquo; asked the Professor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I ran up there, calling her name, but
came right down again and left immediately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Kelley, of course it&rsquo;s murder&mdash;as
you probably know. I suppose you&rsquo;ll hold this
fellow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I certainly intend to,&rsquo; replied the Inspector.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_11">How did Fordney know the old lady had been murdered?</a></p>

<br /><i>Class Day</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Baklioff, in person, combined with &ldquo;Grand
Hotel,&rdquo; had packed the Paramount,&rsquo; said the
Professor. &lsquo;Every seat was occupied and
standing-room was at a premium. What an
opening it was!&rsquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As the picture neared its end and the orchestra,
under the magnificent leadership of
Baklioff, reached the climax of Mascagni&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cavalleria Rusticana,&rdquo; a shot rang out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Inspector Kelley who accompanied me, was
immediately on his feet bellowing, &ldquo;Lights!&rdquo;
They were quickly turned on and the picture
stopped. Warning everyone to keep his seat,
we started for the back of the theater, when a
man&rsquo;s body slumped out of a seat and fell
almost at our feet. A hurried examination
disclosed he had been shot in the back of the
head and that he was an extremely tall man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leaving Kelley to look after things, I
hurried to the operator&rsquo;s booth. When almost
there, I heard another shot and knew I was too
late. Entering the small compartment, hung
under the balcony, I found the operator with
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
a bullet through his temple and a smoking
revolver by his side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not much to this,&rdquo; I remarked, as Kelley
joined me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I wonder if he got the right man,&rdquo; commented
the Inspector. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
how he could have made such a splendid shot
under the circumstances. Amazing!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was the dead man sitting in an aisle seat?&rsquo;
interrupted one of the class.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s a good one, Professor, but I
know now the one thing wrong with your
story,&rsquo; said the student.</p>

<br /><i>A Hot Pursuit</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Hello, Smith,&rsquo; said Professor Fordney as he
opened the door. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle Fred&rsquo;s house has been robbed. He
had some negotiable bonds in the library safe
and told me to stick close to home until he
returned from New York.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were they stolen?&rsquo; interrogated Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. I was up in my bedroom
about twenty minutes ago when I heard a
noise. I rushed downstairs just in time to see
a man dash out of the library. I ran after him
and, as I passed the door, I noticed the safe
was open, so I suppose he got the bonds. He
jumped into a waiting automobile and I trailed
him in my car which, fortunately, was standing
in front of the house, but he got away from
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you get his license number?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. Couldn&rsquo;t see it. When I lost him in
the traffic, I drove right over here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you keep the house locked while
you were upstairs?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but the burglar chiseled open a cellar
window.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go over and have a look,&rsquo; suggested
Fordney.</p>
<p>When they reached the Smith home, they
found the bonds gone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you lock the front door when you ran
out of the house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;er,&rsquo; replied Smith nervously, &lsquo;the door
locks automatically. I don&rsquo;t know what Uncle
Fred will say when he gets back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll say plenty if you tell him the story
you told me,&rsquo; interrupted the Professor. &lsquo;I
suggest you put the bonds back.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_13">Where did Smith make his incriminating slip?</a></p>

<br /><i>A Question of Identity</i></h3>
<p>Professor Fordney and three of his friends
were enjoying their weekly &lsquo;get together&rsquo; at
the University Club.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Professor,&rsquo; said Patrie, &lsquo;tell us something
about that Yelpir murder case you were working
on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, gentlemen,&rsquo; he replied, in his retiring
manner, &lsquo;as you know, Yelpir&rsquo;s affairs were
common knowledge, and the fact that several
women had reasons to wish him dead complicated
matters a bit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His body was found in his study, which
opened on to a corridor. At the other end of
the corridor and directly opposite it a staircase
led to the servants&rsquo; quarters above.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Diana Lane, a house guest of Mrs. Yelpir
at the time of the murder, was questioned, and
she appeared nervous. She insisted, however,
that she had been in her room at the time
Yelpir was slain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nora, a servant, testified that, as she was
descending the stairs leading from the servants&rsquo;
quarters, at midnight, she saw Diana
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
Lane, wearing her famous emerald pendant
and dressed in an enticing black neglig&eacute;e, walk
down the lighted corridor to Yelpir&rsquo;s room.
She said she followed a minute later and heard
Diana and Yelpir violently quarreling. She
returned to the servants&rsquo; quarters and, as she
opened the door of her room, she heard a shot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the face of such evidence, Miss Lane
admitted having gone to the study at the time,
but protested her innocence, declaring she had
remained only a minute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While Miss Lane was acquitted, you know,
her reputation was not above reproach. Even
so, I knew without further investigation that
Nora&rsquo;s testimony was maliciously false.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_14">How did the Professor know?</a></p>

<br /><i>A Yachtsman&rsquo;s Alibi</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve often remarked,&rsquo; said Professor Fordney,
in an expansive mood, &lsquo;how very difficult it is
to fake an alibi without someone&rsquo;s assistance.
A case in point is a messy affair we cleared up
recently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t definitely suspect Picus when I
happened to bump into him at the Fourth-of-July
parade, the morning after an acquaintance
of his had been found dead under suspicious
circumstances. I rather casually asked
him where he had been and what he had been
doing the previous afternoon about four
o&rsquo;clock, the apparent time of the man&rsquo;s death.
He related the following story:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I took my sailboat out about noon yesterday.
It was great on the water. Around three
o&rsquo;clock, however, when I was perhaps ten
miles out, the wind died down completely.
There wasn&rsquo;t a breath of air, and I knew that,
unless I could attract some boat, I was in for
an uncomfortable time. Remembering that
the international distress signal is a flag flown
upside down, I ran mine up to the top of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
mast in that manner. Thank God it was a
clear day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;In about an hour the steamer Leone hove
to, and I went aboard her after securing my
boat with a towline. The Captain said he had
seen my distress signal about four miles away
and would put me ashore at Gladsome Landing.
He did so, and, as there was no one about, I
hailed a passing motorist who gave me a lift
back to town. Imagine my surprise when I
read in the paper this morning that the Leone
had been sunk in a storm after putting me
ashore, and all hands had been lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;While I knew,&rsquo; remarked the Professor,
&lsquo;that the Leone had been sunk with all on
board, after hearing Picus&rsquo;s story I immediately
arrested him on suspicion of murder.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_15">What was wrong with Picus&rsquo;s alibi?</a></p>

<br /><i>Murder at Coney Island</i></h3>
<p>Inspector Kelley and Professor Fordney
were seated in the former&rsquo;s office when Policeman
Fanning and his charge entered. After
Fanning&rsquo;s hurried explanation, Jasper told
his story:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m the ticket taker on a merry-go-round
at Coney Island. This bein&rsquo; Saturday, we had
a big crowd. The trip was almost over when
I reached out, saying, &ldquo;Ticket, please,&rdquo; and
I see this woman sittin&rsquo; up in the middle of the
chariot with that terrible look on her face. She
didn&rsquo;t answer, and when I shook her, she
slumped over in the corner. I screamed,
jumped off, and ran for the manager. I got
blood on my hand when I shook her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, she&rsquo;d ridden a couple of times and
I seen the man she was with on the two rides
before,&rsquo; continued Jasper, giving a detailed
description of him. &lsquo;I happened to see him
jump off just before I got to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The doctor said she had been stabbed
through the heart and had died instantly?&rsquo;
queried Professor Fordney.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir,&rsquo; replied the policeman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems strange, Jasper,&rsquo; remarked the
Professor, &lsquo;that you can give such a good
description of this woman&rsquo;s companion on two
previous rides when you just &ldquo;happened&rdquo; to
notice him jump off. Does the merry-go-round
ever make you dizzy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir; I&rsquo;m used to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Inspector,&rsquo; said Fordney, turning to
his friend, &lsquo;I suppose you are going to hold
this man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied Kelley. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just
about the dizziest story I&rsquo;ve heard in a long
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_16">What justified the police in holding Jasper?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_17">17
<br /><i>Too Clever</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Receiving no reply to my ring and finding
the door unlocked, I went in,&rsquo; said Albert
Lynch. &lsquo;Dawson was seated at his desk shot
through the head. Seeing he was dead, I called
the police and remained here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Touch anything, Lynch?&rsquo; asked Professor
Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir, nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Positive of that, are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Absolutely, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Professor made a careful examination
of the desk and found Dawson had been writing
a letter at the bottom of which and covered
by the dead man&rsquo;s hand, was a penned message:
&lsquo;A. L. did thi&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; and weakly trailed
off.</p>
<p>Further examination disclosed several kinds
of writing-paper, a pen-tray holding the recently
used pen, inkwell, eraser, stamps, letters,
and bills. The gun from which the shot
had been fired was on the floor by the side of
the chair, and the bullet was found embedded
in the divan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>After a few questions, Fordney was quickly
convinced of Lynch&rsquo;s innocence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you make of it, Professor?&rsquo; inquired
Inspector Kelley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Though the scrawled note certainly looks
like Dawson&rsquo;s writing, I am sure an expert
will find it isn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not surprised to find the
gun free of prints. Pretty thorough job, this.
Good thing for you, Lynch, and for us too, that
the murderer was careless about something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right,&rsquo; said Kelley. &lsquo;But you aren&rsquo;t such
a wise old owl, Fordney. This is like the Morrow
case we handled. Remember?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good for you, Inspector,&rsquo; laughed the
Professor.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_17">How did both men so quickly determine that the incriminating note had not been left by Dawson?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_18">18
<br /><i>Bloody Murder</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;A bad mess, this,&rsquo; said Professor Fordney to
Sergeant Reynolds, as they viewed the bloody
scene.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yeah, I wish these guys wouldn&rsquo;t be quite
so thorough when they bump themselves off,&rsquo;
replied Reynolds as he set grimly to work.</p>
<p>A man with his throat cut, the head almost
severed, sat slumped over a blood-spattered
desk. What a horrible sight! His bloodstained
coat flung across the room, the razor!
the shirt! the tie! his hands! covered with
blood, made a ghastly and awesome picture
framed by the flickering light of a dying candle.</p>
<p>After turning on the lights, Fordney bent
down to take a closer look at the man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His face seems vaguely familiar, Sergeant,
but I can&rsquo;t recall at the moment where I&rsquo;ve
seen him. How long has he been dead, Doctor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About two hours,&rsquo; replied the police surgeon.</p>
<p>At this moment the telephone rang. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
caller, upon hearing Fordney&rsquo;s voice, immediately
disconnected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Odd,&rsquo; murmured the Professor as he hung
up the receiver. &lsquo;I remember now where I saw
this man. His name is Thompson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he glanced around, he observed that the
alarm-clock on the dresser had stopped just
two hours and fifteen minutes before.</p>
<p>The telephone rang again and Fordney
motioned Reynolds to answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hello!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Mr. Thompson stepped
out for a few minutes. Leave your number.
I&rsquo;ll have him call you.&rsquo; The man at the other
end inquired who was speaking and, when
Reynolds replied, &lsquo;A friend,&rsquo; he hung up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better trace that call, Sergeant; this is
murder,&rsquo; said Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; exclaimed Reynolds. &lsquo;Still looks
like suicide to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_18">Do you agree with Reynolds or the Professor? Why?</a></p>

<br /><i>Death Back-Stage</i></h3>
<p>Claudia Mason, beautiful and popular young
actress, was found lying across the chaise-longue
in her elaborately furnished dressing-room,
dead from a bullet wound in the temple.</p>
<p>She had sold her jewels and, with an heroic
gesture, partially paid her many debts.</p>
<p>Near Claudia&rsquo;s right hand, Sergeant Reynolds
picked up the revolver with which she
had been killed, and after careful examination
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No finger-prints, of course. Gosh, Fordney,
there&rsquo;s two rocks she didn&rsquo;t sell,&rsquo; he exclaimed,
pointing to a large emerald on her left hand
and a diamond on her right.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Call Maria, her maid. I want to find out
who this fellow is,&rsquo; said the Professor, nodding
toward a man&rsquo;s photograph signed, Juan.
&lsquo;This was evidently addressed to him,&rsquo; he said,
passing over a note which read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Juan:</p>
<p>I am so despondent. The money from
my jewels was not nearly enough.</p>
<p><span class="jr">Claudia</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&lsquo;Not many of these dames kill themselves
over their debts,&rsquo; muttered Reynolds as he
went to call Maria.</p>
<p>The maid entered the room, sobbing and
hysterical.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is Juan?&rsquo; asked Professor Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s the leading man in the show.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t this note delivered to him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forgot it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You found her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. When I came to help her dress she&mdash;was&mdash;like
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Juan in his dressing-room now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Reynolds brought him into Claudia&rsquo;s
room, he dropped to his knees beside the dead
girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My God! She&rsquo;s killed herself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, she hasn&rsquo;t, young man. She was murdered,&rsquo;
said the Professor.</p>

<br /><i>An Easy Combination</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;I was working late, preparing an advertising
campaign,&rsquo; continued Fellows whom Professor
Fordney had been questioning. &lsquo;About ten-fifteen
I heard the outer office door click. Being
unarmed, I hurriedly turned out the lights
in my office and waited breathlessly, as there
was a large sum of money in the safe. I knew
my chances of attracting attention from the
tenth floor were small, so, reaching for the telephone,
I hastily dialed Headquarters and told
them in a low voice to send help immediately.
Then, creeping noiselessly to the open safe, I
gently shut the door, twirled the combination,
and crawled behind that big old-fashioned
desk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shortly afterward the robber entered my
office, flashed his light over the place, and
went to the safe. He had it open in a few
minutes, took the money, and left. That&rsquo;s all
I know about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What time is it now, Mr. Fellows?&rsquo; inquired
Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I haven&rsquo;t a watch.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&lsquo;How, then, did you know it was about ten-fifteen
when you heard the door click?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had gone next door for a sandwich and as
I left I glanced at the restaurant clock and
noticed it was ten-five. I had been back about
five minutes,&rsquo; replied Fellows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say the burglar was masked,&rsquo; continued
the Professor. &lsquo;How did you know it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As he focused his flashlight on the combination
and bent over, I saw the mask,&rsquo; returned
Fellows belligerently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very interesting,&rsquo; smiled Fordney, &lsquo;but
you&rsquo;ll have to be a better liar than that,
Fellows, to fool me.&rsquo;</p>

<br /><i>A Modern Knight</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;There was hardly a breath of air as we sat
on the terrace enjoying tea,&rsquo; reminisced Professor
Fordney. &lsquo;Rocca excused himself, saying
he wished to telephone. Shortly after he
entered the house, we heard a shot. I rushed
into the drawing-room and found Rocca,
smoking gun in hand, staring dumbly at the
chair in front of the open window which held
the huddled body of Chase.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A hasty examination disclosed the telephone
receiver off the hook, a single cigarette
stub of Rocca&rsquo;s brand in the ash-tray, a bullet-hole
in the gauze curtain six inches below the
window-sill, and Rocca&rsquo;s open cigarette-case
in Chase&rsquo;s lap. His replies to my hastily put
questions were evasive. Inspector Kelley
arrived while I was talking and took up the
questioning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Did you use the telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You came directly to this room and did
not leave it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Chase was engaged to your sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Did you offer Chase a cigarette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How did that dent get in your cigarette-case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I dropped it about a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Did you shoot Chase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I refuse to answer that question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At this point the doctor arrived and located
the bullet in Chase&rsquo;s body. Rocca then admitted
Chase had been shot with the gun found
in his own hand, but stubbornly refused to say
anything more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your opinion, Professor?&rdquo; Kelley
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Rocca is obviously
shielding someone. We have positive proof he
came directly here and has not left this room.
That, combined with the other evidence discovered,
absolutely exonerates Rocca."&rsquo;</p>

<br /><i>The Jewel Robbery</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;You say that as your butler called for help, a
stranger, by the name of Dudley, was passing
the house and rushed in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; Owings corroborated, as the
two men sat in Fordney&rsquo;s study. &lsquo;It was rather
late last Friday evening before I was ready to
leave town for the week-end, and as Stuben,
the butler, wasn&rsquo;t feeling well, I told him to
stay upstairs and that I would lock up when
I left.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had some diamonds in the safe, so he said
he wouldn&rsquo;t leave the house until I returned,&rsquo;
continued Owings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About eleven that night, he heard a humming
noise and, having the diamonds in mind,
ran downstairs to investigate. Finding the
wall safe open and the jewels gone, he let out
a scream for help.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stuben has been with me for years, Professor,
and I have implicit faith in him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did Dudley see anyone leave?&rsquo; asked
Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; the robber or robbers must have left
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
by the back door, as Dudley was right in front
of the house when he heard Stuben&rsquo;s call for
help,&rsquo; replied Owings. &lsquo;Both men say the
room smelled of cigarette smoke, so the burglars
must have just left.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was the back door unlocked?&rsquo; inquired the
Professor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it was closed. It has a device which
locks it automatically from the outside when
it&rsquo;s pulled to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better swear out a warrant for
your butler and Dudley,&rsquo; said Fordney. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
sure they know where your diamonds are.
Long service, you know, isn&rsquo;t necessarily a
pledge of loyalty.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_22">Why did Fordney so advise Owings?</a></p>

<br /><i>Before the Coroner&rsquo;s Inquest</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s run over your testimony before the inquest
opens,&rsquo; said Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; replied Curry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About three-thirty on Thursday, I got into
the boat in front of my cottage and rowed upstream.
About fifty yards below the bridge,
I looked up and saw Scott and Dawson going
across it in opposite directions. As the two men
passed, Scott reached out, grabbed Dawson,
and hit him in the jaw. Then he pulled a gun,
and, in the scuffle that followed, Scott fell off
the bridge. He dropped into the water, but,
as the current was strong, by the time I
reached the spot, he had sunk. When I finally
pulled him into the boat, he was dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it a clear day?&rsquo; asked Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it had been showering early in the
afternoon, but the sun was shining then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you positive Scott got that bruise by
hitting his head on the rocks when he fell? The
prosecution, you know, is going to claim that
Dawson hit him on the head with something,
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
then deliberately pushed him off the bridge,&rsquo;
commented Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>know</i> he got that bruise on the rocks,&rsquo;
stated Curry emphatically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said the Professor, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t
think the jury will believe you. Personally,
I&rsquo;m sure Dawson didn&rsquo;t intentionally kill
Scott, but we&rsquo;ll have to have better proof than
that if we hope to acquit him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the way,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;be sure to state
you knew of the grudge Scott bore Dawson.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_23">Why was the Professor doubtful the coroner&rsquo;s jury would believe Curry&rsquo;s testimony?</a></p>

<br /><i>The Fifth Avenue Hold-Up</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the hurry?&rsquo; asked Professor Fordney,
as Baldwin collided with him in the doorway
of the office at the back of the exclusive Cross
Jewelry Store.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;was going to help search for the
robbers,&rsquo; stammered Baldwin as he backed
into the office.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, tell me what happened first,&rsquo; said
Fordney, as Dr. Lyman, police surgeon, knelt
beside Mr. Cross.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the special safe for the emerald
behind that miniature portrait. I was in here
when Mr. Cross entered with two gentlemen,&rsquo;
exclaimed Baldwin nervously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He asked me to bring in a tray of diamonds.
I set it on the table&mdash;both men
pulled guns and as Cross protested, one of
them knocked him unconscious with a blow on
the head. The other forced me into that chair
saying, &ldquo;All right, buddy. We&rsquo;ll wait on ourselves.&rdquo;
Then he put the diamonds in his
pocket. I&rsquo;m thankful I&rsquo;m alive. I telephoned
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Headquarters, then rushed out into the store,
but they had escaped,&rsquo; concluded Baldwin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So they got away with the famous Cross
emerald, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. The safe door was slightly open. Mr.
Cross tried to call my attention to it with a
jerk of his thumb as the robber pocketed the
diamonds. Otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t have
discovered it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is he, Doctor?&rsquo; asked Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll never come to, I&rsquo;m afraid. Those two
blows on the head were a bit too much for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two blows!&rsquo; ejaculated Fordney. &lsquo;Are you
sure, Baldwin, you weren&rsquo;t hurrying away
with the emerald? I&rsquo;m not!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_24">Why did Fordney think Baldwin had stolen the emerald?</a></p>

<br /><i>Behind Locked Doors</i></h3>
<p>At the Collingham home Professor Fordney
found Clive Kingston, the Judge&rsquo;s nephew, and
Watkins, the butler, greatly excited. Forcing
the library door, locked for three months, they
saw the Judge seated in front of the fireplace
opposite the door, apparently dead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait!&rsquo; called Professor Fordney to Watkins,
who had rushed into the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Kingston, as he and
Fordney halted over the threshold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps, but I don&rsquo;t want any clues obliterated.
Come back carefully and get us a
couple of small rugs, Watkins,&rsquo; commanded
Fordney.</p>
<p>Walking only on the rugs placed over the
thick, plain carpet, Fordney and Kingston
reached the Judge&rsquo;s side and found him dead&mdash;shot
through the heart.</p>
<p>Kingston called the Professor&rsquo;s attention to
footprints in the carpet near the fireplace.
As he fitted his shoe to an impression, he said,
&lsquo;These are mine, and those, of course, must be
Watkins&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&lsquo;Throw me your shoe,&rsquo; called Fordney to
the butler, standing in the doorway. &lsquo;Yes,
these are yours all right, and I can see the
third set was made by the Judge&mdash;notice
the impression left by his peculiarly constructed
right shoe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the gun under the table,&rsquo; called the
butler.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty sharp eyes, Watkins,&rsquo; said the Professor,
picking up and critically examining the
gun. &lsquo;No finger-prints, of course,&rsquo; he mused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look!&rsquo; exclaimed Kingston, &lsquo;the glass in
that picture is broken. Were two shots fired?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only one,&rsquo; said Fordney, as with great care
he picked the Judge&rsquo;s nose-glasses from his
lap where they had fallen, unbroken. &lsquo;I think
I know now who murdered your uncle.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_25">Whom did Fordney suspect, and why?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_26">26
<br /><i>Lost at Sea</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Tell us exactly what happened,&rsquo; said Professor
Fordney as he sat in his study with
Mrs. Rollins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a dark, moonless night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At twelve o&rsquo;clock, when we were about ten
miles off Point Breeze, I retired to my cabin,
leaving my husband on deck. We were alone
on the boat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a few minutes, hearing loud shouts, I
joined him again. We could hear a boat approaching,
running without lights, as were we.
My husband told me to return to the cabin,
which I did.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Soon after doing so a bump, tramping feet,
and loud swearing told me our visitors had
come aboard. I went up and, just as I stepped
on deck, a man put a gun against my ribs and
told me to keep quiet. My husband was engaged
in a terrific fight with two others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They must have known he always carried
that leather bag of loose diamonds because,
when he dropped it in the fight, one of them
picked it up from the deck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&lsquo;They finally knocked him unconscious and
took him to their boat after binding and gagging
me. As you know, I was found drifting
next morning by that fisherman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How was your husband dressed?&rsquo; inquired
Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was very hot&mdash;he had no shirt on, but
wore dark trousers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shoes or tennis slippers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;shoes, of course,&rsquo; replied Mrs.
Rollins with noticeable hesitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Fordney tersely, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s amazing
to me that you expect to collect insurance on
your diamonds on such a flimsy yarn. You
and your husband will be lucky if you aren&rsquo;t
prosecuted.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_26">Where did the elaborate story fall down?</a></p>

<br /><i>A Suave Gunman</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Can you describe this fellow?&rsquo; asked Professor
Fordney of Henry Taylor, manager of the
National Theater.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. He was a tall, well-dressed, good-looking
chap. Wore a panama hat, turned-down
brim, blue coat, smart blue tie, natty
white flannels with silver belt-buckle, black-and-white
sport shoes, and had a general air of
culture and refinement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just what did he do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As I was counting the receipts, he came
into the office, gun in hand, and commanded
me to get up from the desk and move over by
that table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After putting the money in a brief-case he
carried, he took out a cigarette and asked me
to light it for him, still covering me, of course.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he gagged me and tied me to the
chair, after which he opened the door, looked
cautiously about, came back and, with a quiet
&ldquo;sorry&rdquo; and a warning, turned and left. As
he passed through the door, he unbuttoned his
coat and slipped the revolver into his back
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
pocket. The show was just letting out, so I
suppose he mingled with the crowd and escaped,&rsquo;
Taylor concluded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you insured against this loss of eight
thousand dollars?&rsquo; inquired Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could you see the color of the bandit&rsquo;s
hair?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was blond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything unusual about him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. Except that he was constantly clearing
his throat in a peculiar manner,&rsquo; replied Taylor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Left- or right-handed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure. Right-handed,
though, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This has gone far enough, Taylor,&rsquo; said
Fordney sharply. &lsquo;The robbery was obviously
framed by you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_27">How did Fordney know Taylor had faked the hold-up?</a></p>

<br /><i>Accidental Death</i></h3>
<p>Returning to town late one night, Professor
Fordney was driving along an unfrequented
road when the sight of a motor-cycle policeman
examining a car in a ditch caused him to
stop and offer his services. Joining the policeman,
he found that a man, obviously the
driver, had been thrown through the windshield
and was lying about six feet from the
car.</p>
<p>His examination disclosed that the man had
been terribly cut about the head. The jugular
vein was completely severed. The bent steering-wheel,
shattered glass, and the blood on the
front seat and floor of the car were mute evidence
of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Fordney also noted the speedometer had
stopped at 62.</p>
<p>A search of the body revealed nothing unusual
except that the man wore only one glove.
The other could not be found. The Professor
was pondering this when the policeman handed
him his report of accidental death, saying,
&lsquo;Is that how you see it, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; replied Fordney slowly, &lsquo;you&rsquo;d
better change that to murder. In the absence
of any further evidence, it seems to be pretty
clearly indicated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Murder!&rsquo; exclaimed the bewildered policeman.
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how you make that
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After explaining his reason and with a final
admonition to continue a careful search for
the missing glove, the Professor returned to
his car and drove down the wide, smooth highway
toward home and a good night&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>Fordney&rsquo;s deduction was confirmed when
the missing glove and the murderer were
found.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_28">How had he arrived at his startling conclusion?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>

<br /><i>Easy Money</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Walker hurried into the kitchen,&rsquo; said
the valet to Professor Fordney, &lsquo;and told me
he was called away unexpectedly and that I
was to go to his library and take the money
he had won last night to the bank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was busy,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;but in about
five minutes I went through the hall, and,
thinking I heard a noise, I stopped and listened
at the study door. There was someone
moving about. The door was open. As I
peered around it, I saw a masked man, gun in
hand, hesitating near the fireplace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he went over to the table in the center
of the room, picked up the stacks of ten- and
twenty-dollar bills, and left by the window. I
called the police immediately and gave them a
description.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly what time was that?&rsquo; asked Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just about ten o&rsquo;clock, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had you been in the library before that,
this morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I hadn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&lsquo;Were you in your master&rsquo;s room today?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. What&rsquo;s that got to do with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; murmured Fordney, &lsquo;nothing at
all! Does your master gamble often?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much did he win last night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Humph,&rsquo; said Fordney, as he pointed to a
bill on the floor, &lsquo;the thief dropped one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see your master has quite a library,&rsquo; he
continued, glancing around the large, beautifully
furnished room. &lsquo;Do you read much,
Wilkins?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A bit, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you ever read, &ldquo;Honesty is the best
policy&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_29">Why did the Professor think Wilkins had robbed his master?</a></p>

<br /><i>Robbery at High Noon</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder who had the nerve to commit such
a robbery at high noon,&rsquo; mused Professor
Fordney as he examined the safe, seventeen
minutes after it had been rifled. &lsquo;Same old
story: no finger-prints, no evidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Found anything?&rsquo; asked Lawson nervously
as he entered his drawing-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not yet. Are you here alone, Lawson?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. John, my nephew, is staying with me.
Everyone else is in town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is he now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, he left about an hour ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At 3.20 <span class="small">P.M.</span> Fordney noticed Jones, the
gardener, working at the edge of a flower-bed.
He kept looking furtively at the house while
he frantically covered over the hole he had
dug. Finishing, he hurriedly walked toward
the boat-landing.</p>
<p>Fordney, following, reached the dock just as
John guided his motor-boat in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have a nice day?&rsquo; asked Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yep. Had a grand run up the lakes.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&lsquo;Where were you when your uncle&rsquo;s safe was
robbed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Boy, I was hauling in a big muskie! What
a battle he gave me! See him in the end of the
boat? Isn&rsquo;t he a beauty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When did you return?&rsquo; demanded Fordney
of the gardener.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what time it was,&rsquo; he replied
nervously, glancing at John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must have some idea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it was about noon,&rsquo; he reluctantly
answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the way, John, do you know the combination
of your uncle&rsquo;s safe?&rsquo; inquired Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that old weasel accusing me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;ve got my suspicions!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_30">Whom did Fordney suspect and why?</a></p>

<br /><i>The Wrong Foot Forward</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;The witness says,&rsquo; explained the interpreter,
&lsquo;that as the car came to a sudden stop the conductor
ran to the front and yelled to the motorman,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it again."&rsquo;</p>
<p>The little foreigner on the witness stand
looked bewildered and frightened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He further says that there were two sailors
on the car and that they jumped off and ran.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have they been located yet?&rsquo; inquired the
Judge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Your Honor; we&rsquo;ve been unable to
trace them, although the conductor gave a
good description,&rsquo; replied counsel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Proceed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The interpreter continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Paslovsky, the witness, declares he had a
clear view of the plaintiff when he got off. He
states that just as the plaintiff put his foot
on the ground, with his back to the front of the
car, it gave a sudden start and he was thrown
to the road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t the witness understand or speak
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
enough English to tell the court about that?&rsquo;
asked the Judge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Your Honor; he&rsquo;s been in this country
only two weeks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can he get about at that hour of night
alone, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some friends put him on the car and telephoned
the people with whom he lives to
meet him at the end of the line,&rsquo; replied counsel
for the plaintiff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Continue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Paslovsky,&rsquo; declared the interpreter, &lsquo;says
he picked up this picture from the floor of the
car&mdash;a snapshot of a sailor and a girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Case dismissed,&rsquo; thundered the Judge, &lsquo;and
don&rsquo;t ever bring another like that into this
court.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_31">&lsquo;Why was His Honor justified in so abruptly dismissing the suit for damages?&rsquo;</a></p>

<h3 class="hq" id="mys_32">32
<br /><i>Death Attends the Party</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;He had a big party last night,&rsquo; said Graves,
the valet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly looks like it,&rsquo; retorted Professor
Fordney, as he surveyed the crazily balanced
glasses, overflowing ash-trays, and liquor rings
on the small, fragile antique table at which
Carlton Dawes sat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was awful, sir. Just as I turned to say
&ldquo;good night&rdquo; to him, he lifted his revolver,
fired and toppled over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Funny,&rsquo; mused Fordney. &lsquo;He had everything
to live for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everything but the thing he wanted,&rsquo; replied
the valet. &lsquo;Madeline, his former wife,
was here last night. He is always despondent
after seeing her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Graves, pretty nice for you, eh?
How much did he leave you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ten thousand dollars, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fordney leaned over to examine the wound
in Dawes&rsquo;s left temple. His head rested on the
edge of the table, his right hand on his knee
and his left hung lifelessly at his side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&lsquo;Anything been touched since the tragedy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fordney picked up Dawes&rsquo;s revolver where
it had apparently fallen from his hand. After
examining it and finding only the dead man&rsquo;s
finger-prints, he laid it on the table. As he
did so, Madeline entered the room. She
stopped, horrified.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;what&mdash;has happened?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where did you come from?&rsquo; demanded
Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been upstairs. I didn&rsquo;t leave with the
guests.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Humph&mdash;you should have,&rsquo; as he shot her
a quizzical look. &lsquo;Your presence may prove
embarrassing. Your ex-husband was murdered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Madeline slipped to the floor in a dead
faint.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_32">What convinced Fordney it was murder?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_33">33
<br /><i>No Way Out</i></h3>
<p>On a battered desk in the small, dark room
lay a penciled note in handwriting resembling
that of the dead man:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear John:</p>
<p>You know the trouble I&rsquo;m in. There&rsquo;s
only one way out and I&rsquo;m taking it.
You&rsquo;re my pal and will understand.
Good luck.</p>
<p><span class="jr">(Signed)<span class="hst"> Paul</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only other furniture consisted of the
chair in which Paul Morrow had been found
with his throat cut, a bed, and a highly ornate
and apparently brand-new waste-basket. It
had been definitely established that the dead
man had not left the room during the twenty-four
hours before he was discovered.</p>
<p>Finishing his examination of the contents of
the man&rsquo;s pockets&mdash;two twenty-dollar bills,
a cheap watch, and an expensive wallet in
which there was a picture of a beautiful
woman&mdash;Fordney turned his attention to
the meager inventory of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all we can find,&rsquo; said Inspector
Kelley, indicating a dictionary, scraps of a
letter in a feminine handwriting found in the
ornate waste-basket, a pen, some cheap stationery,
a few clothes, pipe and tobacco, and a
bloody, razor-sharp knife. &lsquo;Certainly has all
the appearances of suicide,&rsquo; he continued.
&lsquo;This door was locked and no one could have
left by that window. What do you make of it,
Fordney?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Professor didn&rsquo;t reply at once. He
picked up the photograph, studied it a moment,
and then, with a slow, searching look
around the small room, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better try to piece those bits of letter together.
This isn&rsquo;t suicide; it&rsquo;s murder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; exclaimed Kelley,
with dawning comprehension.</p>

<br /><i>Midnight Murder</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Who are you, and what&rsquo;s this all about?&rsquo; demanded
Inspector Kelley, as he and Professor
Fordney arrived at the apartment in answer
to a call.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m Jack Day. I share this apartment with
Al Quale. I returned from the theater, shortly
after midnight, went into his room, and found
him lying there on the bed. When I saw he
was dead, I called Headquarters at once.
God, this is terrible!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those your things on the bed?&rsquo; asked
Kelley, indicating a blood-stained muffler, a
hat, gloves, and cane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I tossed them there before I rushed to
the telephone. Got that blood on the muffler
when I bent over him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What time did you leave here this evening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shortly before seven,&rsquo; replied Day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you prove you were at the theater all
evening?&rsquo; demanded Kelley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, yes, I went with a friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s been dead about six hours, Inspector,&rsquo;
said the police surgeon, finishing his examination
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
at this point. &lsquo;A deep knife wound, below
the heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Fordney picked up an earring from the
floor, Day exclaimed: &lsquo;Why, that belongs to
his fianc&eacute;e.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;ll be no wedding bells for him,&rsquo;
remarked Kelley, with a start as he discovered
that Day&rsquo;s cane was a sword-stick with a long,
thin, shining blade.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any blood, Inspector?&rsquo; asked Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;None. Clean as a whistle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Day, looks mighty bad for you,&rsquo;
stated the Professor. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet
whether you killed him with that cane, or
whether you killed him at all, but I do know
you were here a few minutes after he was
stabbed.&rsquo;</p>

<br /><i>Speakeasy Stick-Up</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;I had counted the cash, and as I was working
the combination to open the wall safe I heard
this guy in back of me say, &ldquo;Get &rsquo;em up, Bo.
This is a stick-up.&rdquo; I reached for the ceiling
as he says, &ldquo;Make a move and I&rsquo;ll drill you!&rdquo;
He didn&rsquo;t sound like he was foolin&rsquo;, so I kept
quiet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he comes over, gives me a prod with
his gun, pockets the dough, and asks me where
the best liquor is, saying he don&rsquo;t want no bar
whiskey either. I told him and he poured himself
a drink.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he got real sociable-like, but wouldn&rsquo;t
let me take my hands down. He kept on
talkin&rsquo; and makin&rsquo; wise-cracks, but finally got
tired, I guess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With a warnin&rsquo; that, if I moved before I
could count twenty, my wife would be a widow,
he beat it,&rsquo; concluded Sullivan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much did he take?&rsquo; inquired Professor
Fordney, who had entered the speakeasy after
hearing the bartender&rsquo;s call for help.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&lsquo;About five hundred dollars,&rsquo; Sullivan replied.
&lsquo;We had a good day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you a gun here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure, but I didn&rsquo;t have a chance. I ain&rsquo;t
exactly no boy scout, but this mug was too
big and tough-lookin&rsquo; for me to tackle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you get that cut on your hand?&rsquo;
inquired the Professor. &lsquo;And that bruise on
your finger?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Opening a case of lemons,&rsquo; answered Sullivan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Fordney, &lsquo;if your whiskey isn&rsquo;t
any better than your attempt at a fake hold-up,
I&rsquo;ll have ginger ale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. The bruise had nothing to do
with it, but:</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_35">How did Fordney know the stick-up was a fake?</a></p>

<br /><i>Behind Time</i></h3>
<p>Professor Fordney, on his way to investigate
a case of blackmail, was musing on the perversity
of human nature when a jar threw him
into the aisle as the train came to a sudden
stop. Jumping off, he rushed ahead of the
engine, where he found a small crowd gathered
about the mutilated body of a man hit by
the train. He was identified by a card in his
pocket as John Nelson, an important figure in
railroad labor circles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did it happen?&rsquo; inquired Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied Morton, the engineer, &lsquo;I
was running twelve minutes late when I hit
him. There are several miles of straight-away
along here and I was beating it along at sixty
miles trying to make up time. Didn&rsquo;t see
him until we were about ten yards away, right
on top of him. I jammed on the brakes, of
course, but it was too late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you leave New York on time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir. One-thirty exactly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why were you running late?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&lsquo;We were held in a block for about fifteen
minutes outside of New Haven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was your fireman doing when you hit
this man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stoking the boiler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say it was just a few seconds after
four-ten when you hit him?&rsquo; demanded the
Professor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; agreed Morton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you know this man by any chance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, slightly&mdash;he was an officer in my
union,&rsquo; replied the engineer, with a worried
look.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Fordney, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know your
object in telling such a story, or how you
hoped to get away with it&mdash;you won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_36">What justified Fordney in recommending Morton&rsquo;s arrest?</a></p>

<br /><i>A Broken Engagement</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Peculiar,&rsquo; murmured Fordney, as he examined
the desk on which lay seven letters
ready for mailing, three gray, one lavender,
two pink, and one lemon-colored.</p>
<p>As he idly shaped the wax of the candle
standing on the desk, he continued to ponder
this unusual choice of color in stationery.</p>
<p>One of the letters was addressed to Dot
Dalton, who had been murdered between
eleven-forty and eleven-fifty. She was one of
the guests at this house party in the Adirondacks.</p>
<p>All the letters were closed with black sealing
wax stamped with the letter &lsquo;F.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At midnight, Fordney began his questioning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What time did you retire?&rsquo; he asked Molly
Fleming, in whose bedroom he was seated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About ten,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was your door locked?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hear any disturbance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I was tired, fell asleep almost immediately,
and didn&rsquo;t awaken until you
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
knocked on my door a few minutes ago and
told me of the tragedy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you write to Dot?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t see her last night and knew she
intended leaving early this morning. Jack
Fahey broke our engagement yesterday and
told me he was going to marry Dot. My
letter was to tell her just how despicable I
thought she was in luring him away from
me. He didn&rsquo;t love her. Of course, I&rsquo;m sorry
she&rsquo;s dead, but a lot of wives will feel safer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why the various colors of stationery?&rsquo; inquired
the Professor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I always write in a color that seems to
reflect the personality of my correspondent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Fordney; &lsquo;but unless you have a
better alibi you&rsquo;ll be held under serious suspicion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_37">Why was the Professor practically certain Molly was involved in this horrible murder?</a></p>

<br /><i>The Holden Road Murder</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;What a night!&rsquo; sighed Professor Fordney as
he hung up the telephone receiver. Half an
hour later, still grumbling, he splashed his way
through the mud and rain to the door of 27
Holden Road. Removing his rubbers in the
spotless vestibule, he stepped into a large,
well-furnished living-room running the entire
width of the house. Introducing himself and
explaining he would question everyone later,
he asked to be left alone.</p>
<p>In the far corner of the room he found a man
lying on the floor, his throat cut. As he bent
over, his attention was attracted to a dime
lying about five feet from the head of the dead
man. He picked it up, regarded it curiously,
and, with a thoughtful look, put it in his
pocket.</p>
<p>The Professor began his questioning with
the butler.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You found the dead man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, I was returning from posting a letter
about thirty minutes ago and, just as I was
coming up the path of the front door, I heard a
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
scream, dashed in, and found Mr. White here
gasping his last breath.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lose a dime?&rsquo; inquired Fordney mildly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t think so, sir,&rsquo; replied the butler
nervously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard the scream from upstairs,&rsquo; volunteered
Cannon, owner of the house, &lsquo;and ran
in here right behind Wilkins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did either of you leave this room before I
arrived?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Cannon; &lsquo;we stayed here until
you came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you, Mr. Cannon, lose a dime? No?
Well,&rsquo; remarked Fordney, &lsquo;it looks like collusion
to me and I can tell you Inspector Kelley
won&rsquo;t swallow this story.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_38">What was wrong with the story?</a></p>

<br /><i>Fishermen&rsquo;s Luck</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Having these stones in my possession, Professor
Fordney, isn&rsquo;t proof that I had any part
in the Morris robbery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know all about your story, Holmes.
Found the jewels yesterday at three o&rsquo;clock
in the lake, tied up in a chamois bag, didn&rsquo;t
you? But what were you doing out in an open
boat in the cloudburst that lasted all yesterday
afternoon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was because of that cloudburst that I
sallied forth,&rsquo; explained Holmes confidently.
&lsquo;Perfect fishing weather, so I jumped into my
boat and went across the lake for some minnows.
I had rowed back to within a few yards
of shore when I just happened to notice the
bag lying on the bottom of the lake, so I
landed, tipped my boat over to keep the rain
out, and waded in. Curious, you know. The
water at that point was over my waist and
cold, but when I opened the bag&mdash;my courage
and curiosity were rewarded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On which side of the dock did you find it?&rsquo;
asked Fordney.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Holmes pointed to a spot on the sandy bottom
at the left.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Think I&rsquo;ll talk with the minnow man,&rsquo;
declared the Professor as he got into Holmes&rsquo;s
boat. He rowed furiously for about fifty
yards, suddenly dropped the oars and, after
glancing from the crystal-clear water to the
bottom of the boat, emitted a victorious
chuckle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stupid of me not to have thought of that
before,&rsquo; he mused. &lsquo;Wonder if Holmes is a
better fisherman than he is a liar?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_39">Clever fellow, Holmes. Did his story fool you?</a></p>

<br /><i>The Unlucky Elephant</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Dead! Bullet-hole in right temple,&rsquo; said
Sergeant Reynolds, as he knelt by a man lying
face down, a revolver clutched in his right
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; replied Inspector Kelley. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s
have a look round. Dressed for the street, eh?&rsquo;
While speaking, Kelley picked up from the
floor several fragments of glass and a right-hand
glove, turned inside-out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look at this glove, Reynolds. What do you
make of it? And I wonder if that soiled handkerchief
on the table belongs to him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gee, Chief,&rsquo; said Reynolds, as he turned the
body over and unbuttoned the topcoat, &lsquo;this
is young Holman, the millionaire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The body was immaculately clothed in the
finest custom tailoring.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Broke his watch, too. Stopped at eight-ten,&rsquo;
continued the Sergeant, as he removed
the timepiece from the vest pocket. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see
if those pieces you&rsquo;ve got are part of the crystal.
Yep! And look at this jade elephant at the end
of the chain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&lsquo;Bumped himself off, all right, Inspector, but
I don&rsquo;t get that glove business, or that dirty
handkerchief either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;d better look round and find that other
glove,&rsquo; said Kelley.</p>
<p>A thorough search failed to disclose it, and
while the Inspector was confident it was suicide,
he decided to get Professor Fordney&rsquo;s
opinion, because of the prominence of young
Holman.</p>
<p>After explaining the situation to the Professor
over the telephone, he was puzzled at
his reply:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be right around, Inspector. From what
you&rsquo;ve told me, it looks like murder.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_40">What justified the Professor&rsquo;s belief that it was probably murder?</a></p>

<br /><i>The Professor Listens</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Why the rush to get back to New York?&rsquo; inquired
Fordney, a few minutes after Delavin
stepped from the plane. &lsquo;Thought you intended
spending the summer in Cuba.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you must know, my bank failed,
and I came back to straighten out my affairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s too bad, Delavin. How did you hear
about it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He handed Fordney a clipping from the
<i>Jacksonville Herald</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New York, July 5. (AP)&mdash;Foundation
Bank &amp; Trust Co., one of New York&rsquo;s
oldest banking establishments, closed its
doors today...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Sure you didn&rsquo;t come back to help your pal
Ryan?&rsquo; asked the Professor. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s been in jail
for two days. Ever since the Fourth-of-July
bombing. Had a letter on him signed by you
asking him to get in touch with a C. J. Wallace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We traced Wallace and discovered he is
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
with an ammunition company. When the District
Attorney heard you were on your way
here, he asked me to meet you. He thinks you
know something about the bombing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In jail, huh? I didn&rsquo;t know there had been a
bombing. Wallace is a cousin of mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where did you catch your plane?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;Jacksonville, Florida. You
see, I was staying at a rather remote place
and no planes serve that part of Cuba. Really
had no thought of leaving until I read of the
bank failure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you had better think of a more convincing
alibi, before the District Attorney
questions you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I suppose somebody wired him that
&ldquo;Spider&rdquo; McCoy met the plane when we
landed in Norfolk. He&rsquo;s got nothing on me!&rsquo;
exclaimed Delavin.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_41">What do you think of Delavin&rsquo;s actions? Suspicious? Why?</a></p>

<br /><i>Ten-Fifteen</i></h3>
<p>Professor Fordney glanced at his desk clock
as he picked up the receiver&mdash;ten-fifteen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hello!&rsquo; came the agitated voice at the other
end. &lsquo;This is Waters. Could you come over
right away? Something&rsquo;s just happened that
I&rsquo;d like to discuss with you. I&rsquo;d appreciate it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; returned the Professor, again glancing
dubiously at the clock, &lsquo;if it&rsquo;s important,
I&rsquo;ll be round. Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, he was met at the
door by Waters&rsquo;s secretary who was almost
incoherent in his excitement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead, Professor. Dead&mdash;there in the
library!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fordney hurried to the room and found
Waters slumped over his desk with his throat
cut.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, tell me what happened,&rsquo; he said to the
secretary, as he noted the position of the body,
the open window, and the cigar-ash on the rug
about six feet from Waters&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came in about an hour ago, Professor,
and went right upstairs to do some work.
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
Twenty-five minutes ago I came down and
heard him talking to you as I passed the library
on my way to the pantry for a sandwich.
I was there about twenty minutes, I imagine,
and, as I came back through the hall, I happened
to look in here, and there he was. I
can&rsquo;t imagine who did it or how it happened,&rsquo;
he concluded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have a cigar,&rsquo; offered Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, I will, Professor. It&rsquo;ll kind of
steady the nerves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said Fordney, &lsquo;suppose you tell
me the real truth of this affair.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_42">Why did he doubt Waters?</a></p>

<br /><i>Rapid Transit</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;I was beatin&rsquo; along the Boston Post Road,
about fifty miles an hour, when I looks around
and sees this bird standing on the tail-gate
fumbling with the lock on the doors. I stopped
as fast as I could, jumped out, and ran round
to the back. This mug had hopped off with an
armful of furs and climbed into a car that was
following. His partner even took a shot at me,&rsquo;
said Sullivan, whom Professor Fordney was
questioning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He must have been a very good judge. He
took only the best you carried,&rsquo; commented
Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yeah. Guess he was. Fur-stealin&rsquo; is a big
racket these days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you report it at the next town
instead of waiting until you got back to the
office?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I thought the boss wouldn&rsquo;t want it
to get out that the furs of his wealthy customers
had been pinched. He&rsquo;s awful particular
about us usin&rsquo; our heads.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where was your helper?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&lsquo;Just after I started out, he said he was
feelin&rsquo; sick, so I told him to go on home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fifty miles an hour is excessive speed for
that truck, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; asked Fordney, examining
the all-steel doors of the massive, dust-proof
moving-van.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s big, but she&rsquo;ll do even better than
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always wear those gloves when you&rsquo;re
working?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always,&rsquo; laughed the driver. &lsquo;Have to keep
me hands dainty, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought so,&rsquo; retorted Fordney, continuing
his close examination of the doors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on, Sullivan, take me for a ride in
that truck. I know you&rsquo;re lying.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;ll I do, Professor,&rsquo; implored Vi Cargo,

bedroom window.</p>
<p>Seven <span class="small">A.M.</span> A fine time to start looking for
a thief! Why couldn&rsquo;t women be more careful
of their jewelry!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was restless all night,&rsquo; said Vi, as Fordney
knelt beside a deep impression of a man&rsquo;s right
shoe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove, I thought we&rsquo;d found one of your
stones,&rsquo; he said, pointing to a leaf in the footprint.
&lsquo;Look at the sunlight glistening on those
raindrops!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was the shower that awakened me
around six,&rsquo; chattered Vi. &lsquo;It only lasted
about fifteen minutes. I dozed off again and
awakened with a start just as a man jumped
to the ground, from my bedroom window.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was that just before you came for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are are you alone, Vi?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. The servants are in the country.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&lsquo;Then why did you have all your jewels in
the house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had worn them to Mrs. De Forest&rsquo;s party.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know anyone who smokes this
brand?&rsquo; asked Fordney, picking up from the
ground an unsmoked cigarette of English
manufacture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. Mr. Nelson, who brought me home
last night. However, I threw that one there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The thief chiseled open this window directly
under your bedroom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wondered how he got in! The doors were
all locked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, my dear! Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;ve

You women! I know your jewels are heavily

<br /><i>A Dramatic Triumph</i></h3>
<p>A clock softly chimed eight-forty-five as
Professor Fordney and Halloway, dramatic
critic of the <i>Times</i>, finished their after-dinner
coffee. They strolled leisurely to the corner
and reached the Belmont just in time for the
curtain.</p>
<p>As the first act ended, Fordney remarked
enthusiastically: &lsquo;Halloway, it&rsquo;s magnificent!
Boswell is certainly our finest dramatic actor.
How he held that audience, for forty-five
minutes, from the moment the curtain arose!
That&rsquo;s genius!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The final curtain found him even more enthusiastic
in his praise of Boswell&rsquo;s acting.</p>
<p>Learning next morning of the actor&rsquo;s murder,
he became personally interested.</p>
<p>Sibyl Mortimer had been questioned by the
police and quickly dismissed. Her alibi appeared
sound. She had an engagement with
Boswell last evening, but said he telephoned
her shortly after nine breaking it, so the police
concerned themselves with his reason for doing
so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>A taxi-driver, who drove Boswell and another
man from the theater, dropped them at
Fifth Avenue and Sixty-Fifth Street at midnight.
His description of the man checked with
that of Jenks, Boswell&rsquo;s manager, who was
missing. It was learned that his reason for
breaking the engagement with Sibyl was to
discuss a new contract with Jenks, about
which there had been considerable disagreement.</p>
<p>A charred piece of the contract was found
in the actor&rsquo;s fireplace, in front of which he
lay. Jenks&rsquo;s cane and a vanity-case monogrammed
&lsquo;S. M.&rsquo; were also found in the room.</p>
<p>Acquainted with the facts by Sergeant Reynolds,
Fordney replied,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve overlooked a valuable
clue.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve been able to learn, Professor.
I wish you&rsquo;d see what you can make of it,&rsquo;
said Sheriff Darrow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Garden&rsquo;s cottage fronts the lake at a point
about halfway between the head and foot of
its mile length.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A strong east wind off the lake that morning
caused him and his two guests to abandon
their proposed fishing trip. Garden remained
behind while Rice and Johnson set off hiking
in opposite directions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rice said that fifteen minutes later, as he
was retrieving his hat which had blown into
the lake, he heard a shot and hurried to the
cottage. There he found Johnson with blood
on his hands bending over Garden, who had
been shot through the heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Johnson said he had gone only about two
hundred yards when he heard the shot and
rushed back. He claims he got the blood on his
hands when ascertaining if Garden were alive.
He also admits moving some furniture, although
cautioned against it by Rice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&lsquo;Fortunately for Rice, we found his hat
still wet, but discovered he had changed his
shirt before the arrival of the police. He had
also gone through Garden&rsquo;s desk, but said he
removed nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Both men entered through the back door,
though the front entrance was more convenient.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We haven&rsquo;t found a gun or any other weapon
and we haven&rsquo;t been able to establish a
motive yet,&rsquo; concluded Darrow. &lsquo;What do
you make of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bit muddled, Sheriff,&rsquo; replied Fordney,
&lsquo;but I would question ________ further.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_46">Of whom was he definitely suspicious&mdash;and why?</a></p>

<br /><i>The Professor Studies a Coat</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;They covered us with a gun, and when the
cashier tried to give an alarm, they shot him.
Then they handcuffed me, grabbed five stacks
of bills, and beat it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Calm yourself,&rsquo; ordered Fordney, &lsquo;and tell
me who &ldquo;they&rdquo; are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two fellows who robbed the bank just
now,&rsquo; explained the excited narrator, who had
rushed into Fordney&rsquo;s cottage at Lakeview.
&lsquo;I knew you were vacationing in the village,
so, as soon as they escaped in their car, I ran
over here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you call a doctor for the cashier?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too late. He must have died instantly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you know the bandits escaped in a
car?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw them from the window.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you and the cashier alone at the time
of the shooting?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. I had just made a deposit. I guess
they got my money, too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fordney walked over and picked up the
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
overcoat his visitor had removed upon entering
the living-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem to have had a little accident.
How did you get this?&rsquo; he asked, examining
a long tear in the front of the coat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;I guess I tore it on the door when I
rushed out of the bank. I broke a button, too,
you&rsquo;ll notice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see your hat!&rsquo; demanded Fordney,
eyeing his visitor sharply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;where is it? I&mdash;must have left it
in the bank!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;let&rsquo;s go. The police will be interested
in your story&mdash;and bring that coat
with you!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_47">Why did Fordney suspect this man of complicity in the hold-up?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_48">48
<br /><i>Too Late</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d better tell me exactly what
happened,&rsquo; said Professor Fordney kindly to
the agitated man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; continued Palmer, &lsquo;Frank has been
despondent and talked of suicide for some
time. I thought exercise and the open air
would do him good, so I suggested a vacation
at my place in the country.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;d been there three days, and he seemed
in much better spirits. Then, Thursday morning,
after we&rsquo;d been fishing an hour or so, he
said he thought he&rsquo;d try another stream about
a mile away. I was having good luck, so I told
him to go ahead and I&rsquo;d meet him at the cabin
later.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About eleven o&rsquo;clock, when I&rsquo;d caught my
limit, I started back. As I neared the cabin,
I seemed to have a premonition of trouble, and
ran the last few yards. When I opened the
door, God! I&rsquo;ll never forget it! I&rsquo;d got there
not more than five minutes behind him, and
yet there he lay&mdash;dead! That hideous look
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
on his face! It haunts me! Why couldn&rsquo;t I
have been just a few minutes earlier?</p>
<p>&lsquo;A whiskey bottle on the table and the glass
which smelled of cyanide told me the story.
He&rsquo;d done it, after all! I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself,&rsquo;
Palmer concluded with a sob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had you any visitors while at camp?&rsquo; asked
Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, we hadn&rsquo;t seen anyone for two days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did your friend smoke?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was the door open or closed when you arrived?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, closed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the windows?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Closed, too, Professor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you&rsquo;re innocent, Palmer, why are you
lying?&rsquo; demanded Fordney.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_48">What was the lie?</a></p>

<br /><i>Sergeant Reynolds&rsquo;s Theory</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Inspector Kelley picks out such nice messy
jobs for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Professor Fordney smiled as Reynolds made
a wry face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We found him lying against a boulder about
ten feet from the bottom of a fifty-foot embankment
of solid rock. While there were no
traces of the path of his fall, the concrete road
directly above him was stained with blood.
I don&rsquo;t know why people insist on walking
along the highway.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s such a bad curve right there. I
don&rsquo;t suppose we&rsquo;ll ever find out who struck
him. And then, it&rsquo;s possible for someone to
have hit him without knowing it. And I
believe the car that did stopped and the
driver seeing how badly he was hurt, in fear,
drove on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What makes you think that, Reynolds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are tracks of a car skidding along the
shoulder of the road, and footprints in the
blood where the fellow dropped on the pavement.
I suppose the poor old man regained
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
consciousness, staggered to his feet, and rolled
down the embankment. That finished him.
Ugh&mdash;it was a messy affair!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re not sure. The only identification
was a small scrap of paper in his pocket with
the name Tabor. By a queer coincidence there
was a large T deeply cut in the blood-stained
boulder which stopped his fall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt, Sergeant, the murderers intended
you should take exactly the inference you have,
but don&rsquo;t you see t____ w__ n_ b____ b______ t__
r___ a__ t__ b______?&rsquo;</p>

<br /><i>Daylight Robbery</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;I went to the office Thursday to do some
work,&rsquo; Shaeffer related.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About noon, I happened to look out the
window and notice a black sedan draw up
and two tough-looking fellows get out. They
looked suspicious to me, and, as I wasn&rsquo;t
armed, I hastily banged the safe door closed
and ran into the washroom&mdash;not a bit too
soon either. In just a few seconds they came
in, one carrying a sawed-off shotgun. I could
see them plainly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They looked around for a moment and one
said, &ldquo;If anybody comes in here before we&rsquo;re
through, give it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He then went over to the safe and, after
working on it for about five minutes, had it
open and took the money. They certainly had
a lot of nerve. Even stopped to count it!
Then they leisurely strolled out the door. I
called Headquarters immediately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much did they get?&rsquo; questioned Inspector
Kelley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Over fifteen thousand. We hadn&rsquo;t banked
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
the money from the day before because Thursday
was a holiday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get the number of the car?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. When it drove up to the office, I didn&rsquo;t
see a license plate on the front, and I couldn&rsquo;t
see the back. When I finished telephoning
for the police, it had gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was there anyone at the office besides you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was alone. A man telephoned an hour
before, however, and asked if we were open. I
told him no, but I&rsquo;d be there until about two-thirty.
He hung up without answering.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_50">&lsquo;Well, fellows,&rsquo; asked Professor Fordney, of the members of his class in criminology, to whom he was telling the story, &lsquo;why did Inspector Kelley immediately arrest Shaeffer?&rsquo;</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_51">51
<br /><i>A Simple Solution</i></h3>
<p>The sun streamed cheerfully through the
window, bringing into lively play the soft tones
of the luxurious furnishings, as the two house
guests, Professor Fordney and Inspector Kelley,
entered the oil magnate&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing in here to get excited about,&rsquo; said
Kelley.</p>
<p>Fordney, opening the window and seeing
Smith lying on the ground three stories below
it, cried, &lsquo;Run downstairs, Inspector. Quick!
There he is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kelley nodded, and was on his way. As he
hurried out the door, he came face to face with
the butler. Fordney eyed the servant suspiciously
as he entered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When did you see Mr. Smith last?&rsquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About an hour ago. He had a telephone
call which seemed to excite him and he came
right up here to his room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who brought this up?&rsquo; Fordney asked,
fingering an unopened letter with an illegible
postmark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&lsquo;He brought it up himself, sir, saying he was
not to be disturbed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anyone been here since?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kelley&rsquo;s noisy entrance interrupted the
butler&rsquo;s &lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Smith broke his neck. I found this on him,&rsquo;
he remarked, handing the Professor a note.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ill health and financial trouble have
made life a burden. I&rsquo;m leaving my bedroom
for the last time. A three-story drop
and my misery will be over.</p>
<p><span class="jr">Smith</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;His suicide will be a blow to the oil industry,&rsquo;
Kelley mused, as Fordney sat down at
the desk and began to write with Smith&rsquo;s
fountain pen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His <i>death</i> will be, Inspector,&rsquo; said Fordney.
&lsquo;Better get the servants together. This is
murder&mdash;not suicide!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_51">What reason did Fordney have for making such a statement?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_52">52
<br /><i>Who?</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;I was trying to stop the flow with this, Professor,&rsquo;
said Weeds, the butler, indicating a
blood-covered towel he had just removed from
the bed, &lsquo;when Jones struck at me and I
dropped it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry I missed!&rsquo; angrily exclaimed
Jones, the colored chauffeur.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind that,&rsquo; said Inspector Kelley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you find her, Weeds?&rsquo; asked Professor
Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a good-looking mulatto,&rsquo; remarked
Kelley, looking at the maid lying on the floor
at the side of the bed. Her right hand outstretched,
the wrist deeply cut, rested in a
pool of blood on the polished floor. &lsquo;Must
have slipped off the bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. The spread hasn&rsquo;t a
wrinkle in it,&rsquo; said Fordney, noting the immaculate
coverlet of pink lace, the edge caught
under the girl&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was almost gone when I found her,&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
offered Weeds, &lsquo;and she died before I could get
a doctor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this yours, Jones?&rsquo; inquired Fordney,
picking up a sharp knife hidden by the girl&rsquo;s
dress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. She wanted it to cut the stems of the
flowers I had brought up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t see that knife when I tried to help
her,&rsquo; said Weeds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Course you didn&rsquo;t! You put it there!&rsquo;
shouted Jones angrily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you know? You weren&rsquo;t here.
And what&rsquo;s more, I heard you threaten her
last night. You don&rsquo;t see any flowers here, do
you, Inspector?&rsquo; quietly asked Weeds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; said Kelley. After whispering
to Fordney, he continued, &lsquo;Come on, <i>you&rsquo;re</i>
under arrest. And <i>you</i>, we&rsquo;ll question you
later!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_52">Whom did Kelley arrest&mdash;and why?</a></p>

<h3 class="hq" id="mys_53">53
<br /><i>Murder in the Swamp</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;d better walk along the edge,&rsquo; said Professor
Fordney, as they started down the only
path leading through the swamp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never thought of that. I was on the porch
when Barton left,&rsquo; said Bob, as he trudged
along. &lsquo;Ten minutes later, I heard a shot. I
ran down the path and found him about five
hundred yards from the house, bleeding terribly
from a wound in the head. I dashed back
for the first-aid kit and bandaged him as best
I could. He died shortly afterwards. Then I
returned and telephoned you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the body of Barton, he explained,
&lsquo;I turned him over so that I could
dress his head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He must have been shot from over there,
because those three sets of footprints are yours
and the other one Barton&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said Fordney,
after a careful examination. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s look in
that underbrush.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Walking into it a few yards, he said,
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s where the murderer stood, all right.
See those powder-marks on the leaves?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>While removing the branch, Fordney cut his
finger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better sterilize that, Professor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Back at the cottage, as he was about to
pick up a mercurochrome bottle from the kit
Bob had used, he observed a spot of blood
on the label. Walking over to the basin, he
saw Bob in the mirror above it, furtively slip
a pair of scissors into the kit.</p>
<p>Turning slowly around, he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have
to hold you on suspicion of murder.&rsquo;</p>

<br /><i>Death by Drowning</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;We were just getting into our boat,&rsquo; said the
elder Carroll brother, &lsquo;when we happened to
notice Ridge out there in the middle of the
river, opposite Wolf&rsquo;s old abandoned dock,
acting very queerly. He jumped up and down
in the boat, and then, all of a sudden, grabbed
an oar, threw it up in the air, and jumped in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We rowed to the spot, and I dived after
him while my brother secured his boat. The
current&rsquo;s fast there, but I&rsquo;m a strong swimmer.
I swam around while my brother rowed about,
but we could find no trace of him,&rsquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We found the oar all right, in the weeds at
Wolf&rsquo;s dock,&rsquo; interjected Riley, of the River
Patrol.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How wide is the river at that point?&rsquo; asked
Professor Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About half a mile,&rsquo; said Carroll.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty lonely, too, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is that,&rsquo; replied Riley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The coroner&rsquo;s report says Ridge had received
a blow of some kind on the chin. Know
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
anything about it, Carroll?&rsquo; inquired Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. Might have hit a rock or the
side of the boat when he went over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you up or down river, from Ridge?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Up river, about three hundred yards, on
the west side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you and your brother have on bathing-suits
at the time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did, but my brother didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are there any blood-stains in Ridge&rsquo;s boat,
Riley?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there are stains all right, and they
look like blood to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised. Hold them both.&rsquo;</p>

<br /><i>Tragedy at the Convention</i></h3>
<p>The Convention was in an uproar! The Drys
were making a determined stand and showing
some unexpected last-minute strength.</p>
<p>The Wets were shouting, clamoring, and
stamping. The Chairman was vainly trying
to restore order amid a scene of wild confusion.</p>
<p>As the excitement reached its pitch, Hurlenson,
a powerful leader of the Wets, told a companion
seated next to him that he felt a heart
attack coming on and was going back to the
hotel.</p>
<p>An hour later, the Convention was stunned
to learn he had committed suicide in his room.</p>
<p>Professor Fordney, a guest at the Convention,
went immediately to the hotel.</p>
<p>In Hurlenson&rsquo;s room he found the police, the
doctor, and Pollert, an influential delegate,
who had discovered him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The last time I saw Hurlenson was at the
party last night, and he seemed in excellent
spirits,&rsquo; said Pollert. &lsquo;I arose late this morning&mdash;my
room&rsquo;s down at the other end of the
corridor&mdash;and I was just leaving for the Convention
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
hall when I heard a shot. I dashed
directly here, but it was too late. He must
have died immediately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did,&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;He apparently
stood in front of the mirror, took aim, and
blew out his brains. There are powder-burns
all around the wound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Learning that none of the maids or any of
the other guests were on the floor at the time,
Fordney advised the police to hold Pollert
on suspicion of murder.</p>

<br /><i>A Murderer&rsquo;s Mistake</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Look, Professor! That&rsquo;s how the murderer
got in, all right,&rsquo; said Tracy.</p>
<p>As Fordney walked over to the ladder standing
two feet from the back of the house, he
knelt down and carefully studied the heavy
footprints around it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose room is that?&rsquo; he inquired, pointing
to a second-story window against which the
top of the thirty-foot ladder rested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Uncle&rsquo;s study,&rsquo; replied Tracy.</p>
<p>Going into the house, Fordney first questioned
Withers, who had discovered the body
of Lane, Tracy&rsquo;s uncle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was reading in my room,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;About
two o&rsquo;clock I heard a noise, so I armed myself
and crept out into the hall. Then I
heard it again, apparently in the study, so I
stole down the corridor, opened the door, and
rushed in. I turned on the lights, ran over to
the open window, looked out, and saw a man
scurry down the ladder, jump off, and run.
I fired twice, but evidently missed him,&rsquo; he
concluded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&lsquo;Were you home all evening, Mr. Tracy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. I had just put up the car when I heard
the shots and saw a figure dash around the
house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take a look at your car later, Tracy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Withers, show me exactly how you found
Lane before you lifted him to the divan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Withers righted an overturned chair,
fitted its legs carefully to four impressions in
the rug at the right of a smoking-stand, sat
down, and slumped over to the left, Fordney
said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s enough. Which one of you killed
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_56">Why did Fordney make this startling accusation?</a></p>

<br /><i>Babe Comes Through</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Strike two!&rsquo; shouted Umpire Starlen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kill the Umpire! You big bum! Thief!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Professor Fordney turned in his place directly
behind the plate to look at the excited
man in the next box, waving an empty pop-bottle.
He smiled. Couldn&rsquo;t blame a chap for
getting excited. Starlen did seem to be calling
them wrong today. That last one <i>was</i> wide!</p>
<p>What a ball game! Six to three in favor of
Philadelphia, last half of the ninth, three on,
two out, and three and two on the mighty
Babe. The crowd was on its feet, yelling
and stamping.</p>
<p>The excited pitcher delivered the next throw
quickly. Just as Babe connected with it for
a home run a bottle hurtled through the air
with terrific force and caught Starlen on the
back of the head. He went down like a shot.</p>
<p>Pandemonium broke loose. Women
screamed, and a panic was threatened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s him! That&rsquo;s him!&rsquo; shouted several
people, as a policeman ran down the ramp
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
and grabbed the man who had attracted
Fordney&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tryin&rsquo; to get away, are you?&rsquo; bellowed the
cop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it! Let go of me!&rsquo; he cried, as
the officer dragged him to the office.</p>
<p>Fordney followed. &lsquo;May I ask a few questions?&rsquo;
he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see your score card, young man. H&rsquo;m,
why didn&rsquo;t you record that last hit? Everything
else is here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I was running at the time. I had an
engagement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Fordney. &lsquo;Officer, you have the
wrong man. He didn&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo;</p>

<br /><i>A Soldier of Fortune</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find Walter Briggs interesting, Fordney.
He&rsquo;s been all over the world,&rsquo; said Attorney
Hamilton over the telephone. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
turned up after two years, claiming his uncle&rsquo;s
fortune. Better dine with us tonight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll be glad to. See you at eight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the three men sat around the dinner-table,
Fordney remarked: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a fortunate
chap, Briggs. What have you been doing in
the thirty-two years you have been away
from America?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, lots of things. Mr. Hamilton, no
doubt, told you I went to the Congo with
Father when I was three. When he died, I
attended school in England. Then I traveled
for a while; did a bit of tiger-shooting in Africa,
killed elephants in India, and became an
ivory-trader, roaming over the Orient four or
five years. I finally drifted into Russia, where
I was a technical advisor to the Soviet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a jolly life you&rsquo;ve had, Briggs!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not altogether, Professor. I was in Manchuria,
where life was anything but jolly. And
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
then, being in sympathy with the Chinese, I
took an active part in the Sino-Japanese War.
It was in China I learned of my uncle&rsquo;s death,
so I came to New York immediately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you remaining here?&rsquo; asked Hamilton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. Me for Paris as soon as things are
settled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a pleasant evening, the three men
parted. Reaching home, Fordney hesitated
about telephoning Hamilton. After all, it <i>was</i>
his duty to advise him to check Briggs&rsquo;s story
carefully before turning over the inheritance.
As for him, he was frankly skeptical!</p>

<br /><i>Number Twenty-Six</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;You fellows <i>must</i> remember that more often
than otherwise the little, seemingly inconsequential
trifles, placed together, lead to the
solution of crime. Never take anything for
granted; examine thoroughly what appear
to be the most unimportant details. You
didn&rsquo;t do so well with your last lesson,&rsquo; said
Professor Fordney, addressing his class. &lsquo;Now
try your wits at this one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I know it sounds fishy, Inspector,&rdquo;&rsquo; continued
he, reading from a paper, &lsquo;&ldquo;but I was
walkin&rsquo; along Sixteenth Street mindin&rsquo; my
business. When I gets in front of number 26
I hears a dame scream &lsquo;Help! Murder!&rsquo; so I
dashed up the steps to the house, pushed open
the door, and rushed in. As I was halfway
through the hall, a big guy steps out of a room
and says, &lsquo;Ah, there, Mr. Farrell, just in time!&rsquo;
I asks him what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on, and just then three
coppers came in and takes me, this guy, and
a woman, in. Neither one of them would talk
to me on the way, so I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s
all about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going around myself,&rdquo; replied the
Inspector. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk with you when I get
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As Kelley turned the knob at number 26,
the door was violently pushed open in his
face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said Detective Bradford. &ldquo;Just
going back to Headquarters. Found plenty
of dope all right. Here&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll be
interested in,&rdquo; showing Kelley a man&rsquo;s hat
initialed &ldquo;D.F.&rdquo; &ldquo;There are three packets of
cocaine under the sweatband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This story, of course, is fictitious,&rsquo; said
Fordney, putting down the paper, &lsquo;but it illustrates
my point. There&rsquo;s just one, small,
unimportant detail that&rsquo;s wrong. To repeat,
you <i>must learn</i> to detect inconsistencies
quickly, however insignificant. Quickly, now!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_59">Do <i>you</i> get it?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p class="tb">In the next few anecdotes you will see the
Professor at work and at play, on cases both
serious and amusing, involving pure deduction.</p>
<p>As in the preceding cases, however, every
fact, with the clue necessary to the solution, is
given. There is only one right and logical answer
to each&mdash;to be deduced from the evidence
presented.</p>
<p>Time yourself; see how long it takes <i>you</i> to
deduce the answer. And then, after you have
solved or missed them, try them on your
friends. They make a fascinating game&mdash;and
there are lots of people who don&rsquo;t play
bridge.</p>

<br /><i>The Pullman Car Murder</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Tell your story to Professor Fordney,&rsquo; said
the superintendent, introducing the conductor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Jackson, &lsquo;last night just after we
left Albany, lower eight let out a terrifying
shriek. I was standing at one end of the car,
the maid, porter, and brakeman at the other
end. We met at the berth as Briggs was gasping
his last from a knife wound in the heart. I
immediately had both doors of the car guarded
as well as the doors to the washrooms. Every
berth was occupied, and by this time the passengers
were milling around in the aisle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I began to look for the missing knife with
which Briggs had been killed. Every passenger,
even the maid, brakeman, and porter,
every inch of the car and all baggage, were
searched, but still we failed to find it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The window-sills were covered with freshly
fallen snow and an examination proved that
none of them had been opened. No one had
left the car and no one had entered either
washroom. I knew the knife must be in the
car&mdash;but where?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&lsquo;Washington, our old Negro porter, really
discovered the murderer&rsquo;s identity by &ldquo;scrutinizin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know your reputation, Professor, so you
will probably have little difficulty in determining
how Washington located the assassin,
but I&rsquo;ll bet you can&rsquo;t tell me where I found the
knife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s face fell as Fordney quickly replied,
&lsquo;As there was only one possible place it
could have been, you found it....&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_60">How long did it take <i>you</i> to discover the knife?</a></p>

<h3 class="hq" id="mys_61">61
<br /><i>Forgery</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Can it be possible that this has happened to
me!&rsquo; thought Everett Taber, as he stood in
the National Bank of New York ready to deposit
his fortune. Having completed his arrangements
late the day before with the bank&rsquo;s
executives, he was the first patron of the morning.
Standing alone in the bank&rsquo;s commodious
quarters, he regretted he had no one with
whom to share his happiness.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as he was making out his deposit
slip, he decided to use his own name, Everett
Mead, instead of his stepfather&rsquo;s name, by
which he had been known most of his life.
It would be a simple matter to arrange this
with the officials later. As he blotted the deposit
slip, Everett Mead felt a new sense of
poise and self-assurance take possession of
him. He gazed fondly at the name which proclaimed
him a wealthy man. By changing it
he could completely sever former associations
and start life anew. What a wonderful day it
was!</p>
<p>The cashier, impressed with the amount of
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
the deposit, was very obliging and wondered,
as he thought of his own meager salary, how it
would feel to have so much money.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see you are left-handed, Mr. Mead,&rsquo; he
said, in an effort to appear interested in such
an important personage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; smilingly.</p>
<p>He left the bank without further conversation.
Less than an hour later his name had
been forged to a check for five thousand
dollars, despite the fact that no one knew he
had changed his name and no one had seen
him make out his deposit slip.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_61">Professor Fordney, acquainted with the facts, knew immediately how the forgery had been accomplished. Do you?</a></p>

<br /><i>The Christmas Eve Tragedy</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Professor Fordney,&rsquo; said Sheriff Brown, of
Lake Dalton, &lsquo;I came to New York to ask your
help in clearing up the murder of Horace
Perkins at Luckley Lodge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit down and tell me about it,&rsquo; invited
Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The family chauffeur, returning from the
station at ten o&rsquo;clock on Christmas Eve, found
Perkins lying in a field, five yards off the Lodge
drive, with his skull bashed in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He telephoned me immediately and I instructed
him to see that nothing was disturbed.
Arriving fifteen minutes later, I personally
examined the ground so no clues would be
destroyed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>only</i> footprints to be found were six of
Perkins&rsquo;s leading from the drive to the spot
where he lay. Around the body were a number
of deep impressions about two inches square.
It had been snowing all day until half an hour
before the discovery of Perkins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leading away from the body and ending at
the main road, two hundred yards distant,
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
were four lines of these same impressions, about
three and a half feet apart in length and about
fourteen inches in width. In some places, however,
they were badly run together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A stranger in our parts is quickly noted and
investigation failed to reveal a recent one.
There were absolutely no other clues and I
could find no motive for the crime. It has me
stumped, Professor,&rsquo; concluded Brown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me a little time,&rsquo; said Fordney. &lsquo;Perhaps
I can help. I&rsquo;ll call you at your hotel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An hour later, he said over the telephone,
&lsquo;Sheriff, look for a man who.... Such
a person only could possibly have committed
the murder.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_62">What did Fordney say to Brown?</a></p>

<br /><i>A Knight of the Bath</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve heard me speak of my eccentric
friend, Joe Leimert, haven&rsquo;t you, Professor?&rsquo;
inquired Jud. &lsquo;Great character! His costly
new Los Angeles penthouse is the despair of
architects, but it reflects Joe, who cares little
for the opinions of others. Particularly in the
matter of baths is his independence reflected.
While he has six of them, he is fondest of the
one leading off his own room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a large all-tile bath twenty-four feet
long, fifteen wide, and seven high, without a
single window. He went in to bathe a few
days ago, locked the door on the inside, as was
his habit, and turned the cold water full on.
When he went to turn it off, he found to his
dismay that the mechanism controlling the
drain and the taps was out of order. He
couldn&rsquo;t let the water out and he couldn&rsquo;t turn
the tap off. Neither could he unlock the door,
and it was impossible to make himself heard.
What a predicament! There he was in a locked
bath with no window, couldn&rsquo;t open or break
down the door, couldn&rsquo;t let the water out, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
turn it off, and he had no way of attracting
attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such a situation might have disturbed
most people, but not Joe. He leisurely proceeded
with his bath and, when finished, nonchalantly
departed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Jud,&rsquo; smiled the Professor, &lsquo;your
friend was indeed eccentric. Of course, there
was only one way out for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_63">This one&rsquo;s easy, don&rsquo;t you think?</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h3 class="hq" id="mys_64">64
<br /><i>Murder in the First Degree</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Inspector, we have your man,&rsquo; said
Fordney as he walked into the office. &lsquo;He gave
us a merry chase, though.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a cool one this murderer is! He
calmly ate his dinner while planning the crime.
He didn&rsquo;t give the cashier a chance&mdash;just
brutally shot him down in cold blood&mdash;and
all for thirty dollars. I tell you, Inspector, a
man doesn&rsquo;t need much incentive to commit
murder these days. After shooting the cashier,
he made a fast get-away in a waiting car.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fortunately, there was a policeman having
dinner in the restaurant at the time, and he
gave orders that nothing was to be disturbed
at the table where the suspected murderer had
eaten.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are several witnesses who will identify
him, including the waitress who served
him, but no jury will convict on that alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While I found none of the suspect&rsquo;s fingerprints,
personal effects, or physical traces at or
on the table, I did find there a sure means of
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
conviction. I am positive he calmly premeditated
this outrage while eating his dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;re right, Professor,&rsquo; said Inspector
Kelley, &lsquo;but both he and his attorney
seem confident. They claim the gun was discharged
accidentally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ll never get away with that. The
Prosecuting Attorney will be able to prove
that this man deliberately planned the crime
while eating his dinner. It&rsquo;s murder in the first
degree!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_64">How did the Professor know the crime was premeditated?</a></p>

<br /><i>A Rendezvous with Death</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;One runs into unique conspiracies in my
work,&rsquo; said Professor Fordney over his after-dinner
coffee. &lsquo;Here is the clue to that Stone
case you are all interested in,&rsquo; he continued,
passing the following newspaper advertisement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WANTED. Competent private secretary.
Unusual salary and opportunity for young
man speaking Spanish. Culture and refinement
necessary qualifications. Address
KR 164.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that gave you a lead.
Looks innocent enough to me,&rsquo; remarked one
of the guests.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the Professor, &lsquo;that ad furnished
the strongest link in my chain of evidence.
I had information that Jack Carroll was infatuated
with Stone&rsquo;s wife. At the suggestion
of his wife, Stone answered this ad and received
a reply requesting him to call for a
personal interview. That interview was with
death!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Stone, when questioned, said she and
her husband had not been on particularly
friendly terms recently and that the last she
saw of him was when he left for White Plains
to see about the position.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I called at the newspaper office and was informed
that the ad had been inserted by Jonathan
Gills, Pomeroy Hotel. They remembered
it because Mr. Gills had telephoned asking if
there were any replies to his ad. Despite the
affirmative answer, they had never been called
for. I found Jonathan Gills was unknown at
the Pomeroy Hotel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I learned from Mrs. Stone that her husband
had answered the ad in long-hand and that he
was left-handed and a very poor penman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pondering the matter, though puzzled at
first, I finally hit upon the manner in which
Stone had been led to his death,&rsquo; concluded
Fordney.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_65">How do <i>you</i> think it was done?</a></p>

<br /><i>A Rum Regatta</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a story that should amuse you, Jean,&rsquo;
said Professor Fordney to his efficient and
charming secretary.</p>
<p>He laughed heartily as he handed her a letter
from his old friend, George Collins, government
investigator in Florida.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Jean read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An old sailor sitting on the sands of
Nassau mending his fishing net was approached
by three rum-runners shortly
after the break of dawn. They came
seeking his advice in connection with a
wager they had made among themselves
the night before.</p>
<p>The three of them, having sampled too
freely of the liquor they were to take the
next day to Miami, had put up three
thousand dollars as a prize for the owner
of the last boat to reach Miami. The
fact that their boss was in a hurry for the
liquor had been completely forgotten.</p>
<p>Sobered, they realized the ridiculousness
of the wager but while anxious to
reach Miami as quickly as possible, they
all agreed it was not to be changed.</p>
<p>The old sailor continued weaving the
cords into his net with slow deliberation.
In a few minutes, calling them to his side,
he whispered exactly the same advice into
the ear of each.</p>
<p>A smile spread over his weather-beaten
face and he chuckled as the three rum-runners
raced to the boats and started for
Miami at top speed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;It is amusing,&rsquo; laughed Jean, &lsquo;but he forgot
to say what the old sailor whispered!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s for you to figure out, young lady.
I&rsquo;ve never been a rum-runner, but I&rsquo;ve got the
answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_66">What advice did the old sailor whisper to the rum-runners?</a></p>

<br /><i>Who is the Heir?</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;As the &Icirc;le de France slipped from her berth,
Europe-bound, John Morgan, the brother of
New York&rsquo;s largest theatrical producer, waved
good-bye to his family on the dock,&rsquo; said Professor
Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Arriving in Paris a week later, he registered
at the H&ocirc;tel Crillon. At two o&rsquo;clock next
morning, he called the office and demanded
he be given another suite immediately, saying
he didn&rsquo;t like the view from his present rooms.
This, despite the fact that he had occupied&mdash;in
fact, insisted upon&mdash;this suite many times
in the past.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because of his prominence and wealth, he
was accommodated at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Moving on to Berlin four days later, he
registered at the Hotel Adlon. The manager,
anxious to please a brother of the internationally
known producer, greeted him personally.
He afterward remarked how worried Mr.
Morgan appeared at the time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning a repetition of
the Paris occurrence took place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&lsquo;From Berlin he went in turn to London,
Copenhagen, Brussels, Vienna, Bucharest,
and Sofia, spending exactly four days in each
place. He then went to Teheran, Persia. He
explained to the American Consul there that
he had come to Persia to sample at first hand
the celebrated wines of Shiraz, and also to
continue his search for one Mirah Svari, a
mystic he had met in New York, and for whom
he had sought vainly all over Europe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the fourth day in Teheran, he was found
dead of an overdose of hashish, in a squalid
house in an unsavory quarter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Receiving news of his death, his attorney in
New York, acting on previous instructions,
opened his will, in which he had left his entire
fortune of five million dollars to the producer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, strange as it may seem, it was found
John Morgan never had a brother. What a
situation!</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_67">&lsquo;Under the circumstances, and according to law, who received the huge fortune?&rsquo; smiled Fordney to his dinner guests.</a></p>

<h3 class="hq" id="mys_68">68
<br /><i>The Professor Stops a Blunder</i></h3>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock Thursday afternoon, Louis
Mundy unexpectedly received a telegram requesting
him to return home immediately, as
his brother was ill.</p>
<p>At eight that evening, he alighted from the
plane in Washington. He had not been in the
city during the past two months. Hurrying to
his suburban home, he found his brother
greatly improved. At ten o&rsquo;clock he set out
on a hike through the country, returning at
midnight.</p>
<p>These facts were all verified.</p>
<p>Between eleven and twelve o&rsquo;clock that
night, John Skidder was murdered, and the
only thing missing from his house was a note
for ten thousand dollars signed by Mundy.</p>
<p>Skidder&rsquo;s secretary said the note was habitually
kept at the office and that she was very
surprised when he took it home that evening.</p>
<p>Mundy declared he saw or passed no one on
his hike, but under severe questioning admitted
having been near Skidder&rsquo;s house
shortly after eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>A thorough investigation revealed that
Skidder had no known enemies and no one,
other than Mundy, had the slightest reason
for wishing him dead.</p>
<p>Mundy was consequently arrested. As he
knew Skidder lived with only an old man servant
(who was out until after twelve that
night), the police believed he had gone unobserved
to the house, demanded the note,
and, when refused, had murdered Skidder.
No one but Mundy could possibly profit by
the disappearance of the note. As it was due in
ten days and he was in no position to meet it,
they anticipated little difficulty in obtaining
a conviction due to the strong motive and
weak alibi.</p>
<p>Asked his opinion, Professor Fordney surprisingly
said he <span class="small">DIDN&rsquo;T</span> believe any American
jury would convict Mundy.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_68">He was right&mdash; Now, don&rsquo;t argue! There&rsquo;s only one answer. Don&rsquo;t peek! Figure it out.</a></p>

<br /><i>The Perfect Crime</i></h3>
<p>Peter Johannes had one burning ambition&mdash;to
commit a perfect crime. After much thinking
and careful planning, he chose burglary
for his experiment and a large brownstone
mansion for the scene of his action.</p>
<p>Learning its occupants had left town, he
arrayed himself in a business suit of conservative
cut, flung a light topcoat over his arm,
picked up a Gladstone bag, covered with
foreign labels, and set out.</p>
<p>He had ascertained, of course, when the
policeman patrolling that beat was farthest
away. At such a time he drove up in his
swanky sport roadster, swung jauntily to the
sidewalk, skipped up the steps, and fitted a
skeleton key into the lock, which yielded
easily. So far so good, he thought.</p>
<p>Inside, he adjusted a black mask to his eyes
and silk gloves to his hands: the former for a
bit of local color he couldn&rsquo;t resist; the latter
for more practical purposes. What a jolly
thing this burglaring was!</p>
<p>He quickly filled his Gladstone with silver
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
and other valuables. Hurrying out, he removed
his gloves after closing the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Done, and not a single clue left!&rsquo; he said to
himself.</p>
<p>As he was about to descend the steps, he saw
out of the corner of his eye the policeman
rounding the corner. Feigning disinterest, he
quickly pushed the bell-button and stood there
whistling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey, you!&rsquo; shouted the policeman, now
standing at the bottom of the steps. &lsquo;What
are you doin&rsquo; there? Them people ain&rsquo;t home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Howdy, Officer. How goes it?&rsquo; said our
hero blithely as he turned to greet the bluecoat.
&lsquo;I know they&rsquo;re not home; been trying to raise
someone for five minutes. Annoying, too,
after running out to see them. Oh, well,&rsquo; he
continued, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be going along,&rsquo; as he unconcernedly
picked up his bag.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You bet you will&mdash;right to the hoosegow,&rsquo;
bellowed the guardian of the peace.
&lsquo;Your story I might have believed, but....
Come on, now, I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; you down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_69">Alas for the perfect crime! &lsquo;What caused our hero&rsquo;s arrest?&rsquo; asked Professor Fordney of his class.</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>

<br /><i>The Professor Sees Through It</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go in to dinner&mdash;it&rsquo;s twenty minutes
after six, and I&rsquo;m starved,&rsquo; said Hawkins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right!&rsquo; responded Professor Fordney, his
train companion, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m hungry, too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two men had met only a few minutes
before, as casually as travelers do, but already
seemed to find each other agreeable
company.</p>
<p>At dinner Hawkins explained he was a conductor
on another railroad and bemoaned the
loss of passenger traffic. Fordney, too, decried
the depression and its effects.</p>
<p>When the conductor came through, Hawkins
tendered a pass with a friendly remark, and
Fordney, who said he had boarded the train
in such a hurry he didn&rsquo;t have time to purchase
a ticket, paid a cash fare. Neither he
nor the conductor having proper change, he
borrowed fourteen cents from Hawkins.</p>
<p>After an enjoyable dinner, they went back
to the club car for a smoke and continued their
chat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&lsquo;Ever been in Savannah, Mr. Hawkins?&rsquo;
asked Fordney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, yes. Several times. Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, nothing in particular. Charming city,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is, but I like the quaintness of New
Orleans better, myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so they chatted through a pleasant
evening until Hawkins, with a yawn, said:
&lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a quarter to eleven. Bedtime for

<p>&lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; responded Fordney. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give
you the fourteen cents in the morning. Don&rsquo;t

<br /><i>The Kidnapers&rsquo; Cleverness</i></h3>
<p>&lsquo;There are times,&rsquo; mused Professor Fordney
from the depths of the most comfortable chair
in the lounge of the University Club, &lsquo;when
the criminal does show ingenuity of a high
order. I recall a most interesting and baffling
case on which I worked ten years ago.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A wealthy man whose daughter had been
kidnaped had been warned that, if he appealed
to the police, she would be killed. Consequently,
it was difficult to get his co&ouml;peration
in running down the criminals. However,
upon receiving the following note delivered
in an express package 12&Prime; &times; 12&Prime; &times;
12&Prime; he sought my advice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Send us, by the means herein given you,
$5,000 in cash, at exactly midnight tonight.
If you do so, your daughter will be
returned unharmed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;My client did as directed and his child
was returned safely next day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know, Jim,&rsquo; asked Fordney of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
fireside companion, &lsquo;what means the kidnapers
employed that made trapping of them, or discovery
of their whereabouts, absolutely impossible?
There&rsquo;s a nice little problem in deduction
for a rising young attorney,&rsquo; he
laughed.</p>
<p class="pqq"><a href="#msol_71">After ten minutes of deep silence on Jim&rsquo;s part, he said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t figure it out, Professor. What was it?&rsquo;</a></p>

<p class="psol">Holmes could not have seen the bag on the

agitation of even crystal clear water under
such conditions would have so disturbed the

not be seen.</p>

<p class="psol">The notice of the bank failure, appearing in
the <i>Jacksonville Herald</i>, was dated July 5th.
This could not have reached Delavin at a
remote part of Cuba, unserviced by planes, in
time for him to get back to New York on the
6th.</p>
<p class="psol">His alibi, therefore, was completely broken,
as he said the newspaper clipping brought him

<p class="psol">Sibyl Mortimer said Boswell had telephoned
her shortly after nine. As he was on the stage

continuously for forty-five minutes after the
curtain rose, he could not have telephoned her.</p>

<h3 class="hsol" id="msol_52"><a href="#mys_52">52. <i>Who?</i></a></h3>
<p class="psol">Kelley arrested Weeds, the butler. He said
he dropped on the bed the blood-covered towel
with which he was trying to arrest the flow
from the maid&rsquo;s wrist as Jones struck at him.</p>
<p class="psol">Yet Kelley and Fordney found the bed
coverlet <i>immaculate</i>. Had Weeds done as he

<p class="psol">The three sets of Bob&rsquo;s footprints in the path
told Fordney the story. Had Bob been at the
house when his friend was shot, as he contended,
there would have been <i>four</i> sets of his
footprints.</p>

<h3 class="hsol" id="msol_54"><a href="#mys_54">54. <i>Death by Drowning</i></a></h3>
<p class="psol">Had the accident occurred as explained by
Carroll, the oar of Ridge&rsquo;s boat could not have
been found, as it was, at the dock <i>opposite</i> the
point where he jumped in. The current would
have deposited it downstream. Therefore, the
Professor recommended the detention of the
brothers.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 class="hsol" id="msol_55"><a href="#mys_55">55. <i>Tragedy at the Convention</i></a></h3>
<p class="psol">Fordney suspected Pollert because of his
own statements that he did not know Hurlenson
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
had returned to the hotel. Yet, when he
said he heard a shot, he ran <i>directly</i> to Hurlenson&rsquo;s
room.</p>
<p class="psol">As his own room was down the corridor, he
could not have known from what room the
shot came, and he had no reason to assume
it came from Hurlenson&rsquo;s room.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 class="hsol" id="msol_56"><a href="#mys_56">56. <i>A Murderer&rsquo;s Mistake</i></a></h3>
<p class="psol">These murderers, like many others, betrayed
themselves by a simple oversight. One look
at the ladder and Fordney knew no man
could have climbed up or down it. The thirty-foot
ladder was placed <i>two</i> feet from the house.
Any person ascending or descending the ladder
in such a position would have fallen backwards
before reaching the top or bottom.</p>

<h3 class="hsol" id="msol_57"><a href="#mys_57">57. <i>Babe Comes Through</i></a></h3>
<p class="psol">There is a screen on the grandstand behind
the home plate.</p>
<p class="psol">Fordney had noticed a few seconds before,
in the box next to him, the man whom the
policeman had caught running down the ramp.
As he could not have thrown a bottle through
the screen, and, in the time at his disposal,
could not have reached either side of the
screen, Fordney knew he was innocent.</p>
<p class="psol">He had noticed the man <i>after</i> two strikes
and three balls had been called, and the pitcher
delivered the next ball quickly.</p>

<h3 class="hsol" id="msol_58"><a href="#mys_58">58. <i>A Soldier of Fortune</i></a></h3>
<p class="psol">Hamilton knew the real Walter Briggs had
gone to Africa as a child. So, when this chap
said he had shot tigers in Africa, Fordney was
very, very skeptical. There are no tigers in
Africa. Oh, well&mdash;look it up yourself!</p>

<h3 class="hsol" id="msol_59"><a href="#mys_59">59. <i>Number Twenty-Six</i></a></h3>
<p class="psol">The inconsistency is this: Farrell said he
<i>pushed</i> open the door. Yet Bradford, <i>inside</i>
the house, <i>pushed</i> the door in Kelley&rsquo;s face as
the Inspector was entering.</p>
<p class="psol">If Bradford <i>pushed</i> the door in Kelley&rsquo;s face,

<p class="psol">Every piece of baggage had been examined
and every inch of the car inspected. All
passengers, even the maid, porter, and brakeman,
had been searched. The knife was still
in the car.</p>
<p class="psol">Remember?&mdash;there was nothing said about
the conductor being searched. The knife was

<p class="psol">No one called at the <i>Times</i> for the answers
to the advertisement, yet Stone received a
reply to his letter of application. The ad was
inserted by Carroll under the fictitious name
of Jonathan Gills and answered by Stone at
his wife&rsquo;s suggestion. She acquainted her lover,
Carroll, with this fact, and he wrote Stone,
arranging the meeting at which he disappeared.</p>

<p class="psol">The old sailor whispered to each, &lsquo;Run the
other man&rsquo;s boat.&rsquo; As the owner of the <i>last</i>
boat to reach Miami was to get the money,
each one raced the boat he was driving. By
doing so, he hoped to beat his own boat, which
was being driven by one of the others.</p>

<p class="psol">Mundy had been unexpectedly called to
Washington. Skidder&rsquo;s secretary said the note
was habitually kept at the office. Mundy,
therefore, could not possibly have known of
Skidder&rsquo;s intention of taking it home. That
was exactly the weakness in the case of the
police. Despite the damning circumstantial
evidence, motive could not be proved unless it

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
